Design Docs V2 is a rebuild of the original Design Docs site using Next.js.

The original was a simple static site. V2 adds:
- MDX for richer content
- GitHub as CMS (edit links, PR-based contributions)
- Better navigation and search
- Responsive design
- Dark mode

The goal remains the same: provide templates and guidance for designers writing design documents. The new stack makes it easier for the community to contribute.
