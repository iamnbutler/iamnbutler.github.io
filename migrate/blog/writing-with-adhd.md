Writing is hard. Writing with ADHD is harder.

I've spent most of my life struggling to get thoughts from my head onto paper (or screen). It's not that I don't have ideas — I have too many. The challenge is corralling them into something coherent.

ADHD doesn't mean you can't focus. It means you can't always control what you focus on. Some days I can write thousands of words in a sitting. Other days I can't finish a sentence.

What helps me:
- Writing in short bursts
- Accepting imperfect first drafts
- Using structure as a scaffold (outlines, headers, lists)
- Writing when the hyperfocus hits, even if it's 2am
- Not forcing it when it's not there

The key insight for me was that ADHD writing isn't broken writing — it's a different kind of writing. Once I stopped trying to write "normally" and leaned into how my brain actually works, things got easier.
