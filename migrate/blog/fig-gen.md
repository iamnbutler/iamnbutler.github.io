fig-gen is a Figma plugin that generates abstract compositions using simple rules and randomness.

The idea was to bring generative art workflows into a design tool — letting designers explore algorithmic patterns without leaving Figma.

The plugin creates shapes based on configurable parameters: grid size, color palette, shape types, randomness. Each generation is different, but the parameters give you control over the aesthetic.

Built with the Figma Plugin API and vanilla TypeScript. No external dependencies.
