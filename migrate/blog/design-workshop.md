Notes from running a design workshop with university students.

The workshop focused on basic visual design principles: hierarchy, contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity. We worked through exercises using only black rectangles on a white canvas.

Constraints make better learning. By limiting the tools (just rectangles), students could focus on the principles rather than getting lost in software features.

The most effective exercise was "make this look important" — given a grid of identical rectangles, make one stand out using only size, position, and spacing. It teaches hierarchy without ever saying the word.
