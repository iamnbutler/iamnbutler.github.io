A concept project to fill the gap left by major League 3V3 sites that shut down. The goal was to get players excited about the game mode through easy access to streams, strategies and stats.

## The Site

We planned to have sections for:
- Home: Overview stats, hype reels, and featured streams
- Champions: Deep dives into champions strong in 3v3
- Team Comps: Strong team compositions and recommendations
- Stats: Personal statistics and growth areas
- Streams: Highlighting 3v3 streamers

## The Champion Page

The champion pages were designed from a learning perspective:
- Popularity charts
- Community-built hype reels
- Full pro games to watch
- Advanced technique videos and explanations

## The Outcome

Sadly, Twisted Treeline was [removed](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Treeline) from League of Legends in 2019 at the end of Season 9.
