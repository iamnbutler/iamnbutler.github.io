A small swag project for my personal booth at the 2016 Grad Show: The Intermission.

We were supposed to make business cards to have available at our booths, but I decided since I already had a job and wasn't really looking for new connections, instead I would use the space to hopefully share a little joy.

These cards were printed with a spot gloss, so the gradient squares were super rich. On the backs of the cards I added little quotes I found that I liked.
