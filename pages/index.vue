        <h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>I'm Nate!</p>
        <h2>Let's build a website</h2>
        <p>I've been dreaming of a simple md-driven site that pulls from a data repository for a long time. Oddly enough, my biggest personal inspiration for a website has been the Mac OS notes app for a few years now. So I'm giving it a shot to see where I get.</p>
        <p>So far I'm *part* of the way there, I've got the `.md` part going... Once the basic site is done I'll pivot to figure out how to pull things directly from my personal <a href="https://github.com/iamnbutler/data">data</a> repo.</p>
        <h2>Why is the site kinda jank?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my very 'build-in-the-open' personal site. Expect everything not to work!</p>
        <p>I'm a bit addicted to things being perfect before sharing. I've actually never shipped a personal site because of this.</p>
        <p>This is my attempt to just throw everything out there, don't worry about things being unfinished, and just build everything a bit at a time.</p>
        <h2>Anyways...</h2>
        <p>Hope you can find something fun in your time here!</p>
        <p>You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/iamnbutler/vercel-nuxt/blob/main/.meta/tech.md" class="underline">tech.md</a> to see all the stuff I'll be exploring on this site.</p>
        <p>For a less broken experience for now, you can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/iamnbutler" class="underline">twitter</a> here.</p>
        <p>See you around!</p>
