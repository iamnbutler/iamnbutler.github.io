        <h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>I'm Nate!</p>
        <h2>Why is the site kinda jank?</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my very 'build-in-the-open' personal site. **Expect
          everything not to work!**
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a bit addicted to things being perfect before sharing. I've
          actually never shipped a personal site because of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my attempt to just throw everything out there, don't worry
          about things being unfinished, and just build everything a bit at a
          time.
        </p>
        <h2>Let's build a website</h2>
        <p>
          I've been dreaming of a simple md-driven site that pulls from a data
          repository for a long time. I've become a bit "files-on-disk" believer
          over the past little while, in a world that is increasingly storing
          everything in the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Structurally, my biggest personal inspiration for a website has been
          the Mac OS notes app for a few years now. I love the simple mental model of `folder &rarr; note &rarr; content`,So I'm giving it a shot to
          see where I get.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far I'm *part* of the way there, I've got the `.md` part going...
          Once the basic site is done I'll pivot to figure out how to pull
          things directly from my personal
          <a href="https://github.com/iamnbutler/data">data</a> repo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a rough
          <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/VNpgDenh0jr5gin1E5YoJt/v-14-moodboard?node-id=0%3A1"
            class="underline"
            >~mood board~</a
          >
          of some themes I have in my head. I don't know how much will influence
          the site in the end... I'm starting from structure and content first
          before style, as I tend to get lost in the visuals and never return to
          finish the rest ðŸ˜…
        </p>
        <h2>Anyways...</h2>
        <p>Hope you can find something fun in your time here!</p>
