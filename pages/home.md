<h4 class="layout-space-large">Hey, I'm Nate!</h4>

<div class="layout-text-columns post-rich-text">
  <p>I’m a designer & maker that has been working in the product design industry for the past 10 years. I believe enabling people to share themselves, their ideas, and their creativity, responsibly & regardless of platform. I don't think our major platforms are doing this well and we have a way to go.</p>

  <p>This makes me passionate about the democratizaion of tools and knowledge — I’d rather teach people the tools to do something themselves than create something that does it for them.</p>

  <p>I want to help the people around me level up, in their careers & lives, to far surpass anything I could even imagine achieving.</p>

  <p>I'm a bit of a collector, and post about all types of things here. You will find a mix of work, top of mind, reflections, random posts & process.</p>
