# Nate Butler — Designer

I’m a designer working in the product design industry for the past 10 years. My focus has been on vision design & expression. I believe in helping people share themselves, regardless of platform.
I’m passionate about democratizaion of tools and knowledge — I’d rather teach people the tools to do something themselves than do it for them.

I want to help the people around me level up, in their careers & lives. I think technology is a tool that brings value but we have to respect and guide it, as it is not innately good.
I'm a bit of a collector, and post about all types of things here. You will find a mix of work, top of mind, reflections, random posts & process.
