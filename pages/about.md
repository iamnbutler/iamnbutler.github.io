## I‚Äôm a designer &amp; maker passionate about democratizing knowledge and the tools that enable people to create.

People should be able to share themselves, their ideas, and their creativity, responsibly &amp; in the way that represents them best. This should be regardless of platform. We aren't doing this well and we have a long way to go to understand technology and it's influence on our lives and society.

This makes me want to help people create the things important to them&mdash;To empower them to create something themselves and feel the euphoria it brings. My goal is always to help the people around me level up, in their careers &amp; lives.

I post about all types of things here. You will find a mix of <a href="/work">work</a>, <a href="/tags/thought">top of mind</a>, <a href="/tags/editorial">reflections</a>, &amp;  <a href="/tags/process">process</a>. Enjoy!
