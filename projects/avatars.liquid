    <h1>TL;DR</h1>
    <p>We built <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/facebook-avatars-stickers/" target="_blank">Facebook Avatars</a>. The bulk of the work was not pixels, but decisions, strategy and representing our diversity.</p>
    <p>Building a large system was hard, required more time and people than expected. Vision and repitition are important to align the team and stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
    <p>In a world of increasingly less social brodcast sharing and the move to private sharing as an overall trend giving people the ability to communicate in a way that feels emotive and personalized becomes increasingly important.</p>
    <p>For many people Facebook (and it's extended ecosystemâ€“IG, Whatsapp, etc) is their online identity, yet this ecosystem lacks personalization that competitors like Snapchat have.</p>
    <p>Through research we validated that, on average, people felt that custom stickers felt more personally expressive than a sticker pack or emojis and felt that they could get across what they meant better by using them.</p>
