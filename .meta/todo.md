# Todo

## Immediate Needs

- [ ] Break out Layout, Head, Header, Page, Footer into components
- [ ] Initial category needs, and single page needs
- [ ] Components for Doc/Fragment/Etc. Whatever I call this.
- [ ] Hook up Vercel deploy

## Later & Ideas

- [ ] Index type to filter
- [ ] Less ugly urls for docs
- [ ] Comment on Twitter component
  - [ ] This could activate with an optional `thread: [url]` prop. Add a twitter thread url and spit out a reply UI element that takes you to the twitter thread to add a comment.
