# Todo

## Immediate Needs

- [ ] Break pages into components:
  - [x] Layout, 
  - [ ] Head, 
  - [ ] Header, 
  - [ ] Page,
  - [ ] Doc, 
  - [ ] Footer
- [ ] Initial category needs, and single page needs
- [ ] Hook up Vercel deploy

## Later & Ideas

- [ ] Post-build script to build index for filter/search
- [ ] Less ugly urls for docs
- [ ] Comment on Twitter component
  - [ ] This could activate with an optional `thread: [url]` prop. Add a twitter thread url and spit out a reply UI element that takes you to the twitter thread to add a comment.
- [ ] Create a mini-package for [Chunk Icons](http://chunkicons.com) and add to site
