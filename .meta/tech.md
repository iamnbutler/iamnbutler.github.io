- @nuxt – Nuxt 2 for the foundational vue library/routing/component auto imports and more
- @nuxt/content – Load md files with yaml front-matter (used for rendering posts, etc)
- @nuxtjs/color-mode – Used for switching color themes
- Tailwind / @nuxtjs/tailwindcss – Tailwind for fast iteration and maintainable components

## Look in to:

TODO's and things to keep an eye on
