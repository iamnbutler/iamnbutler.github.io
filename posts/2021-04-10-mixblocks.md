## The Concept

Inspired by a project a friend did recently about a display that reacts to your music, I started exploring *mixblocks*–A creation & remix tool focused around collaborative creation through the sharing of 'blocks.' While Mixblocks has a feed of creations that you can grab and remix from, it has no likes, no connected identities, and no custom user names. 

## Joining Mixblocks

When joining mixblocks a creator is assigned a randomly generated name & profile image, which they can regenerate any amount of times. This generated name becomes the pseudonym that they create under. Starting from the very beginning of the process, mixblocks is focused on creation and not social presence or clout.

### New Person Flow
The new person flow for mixblocks is focused on getting you in and creating as soon as possible. You can only create an account with your phone number or a secure auth service like Apple authentication. Mixblocks wants to know as little about you as possible.

## Your First Block
Dropping into the app for the first time you will walk through creating your first block. This can be a lightblock or a soundblock, but you have to create something to enter the rest of the app. You can walk through your first app guided (think the first level of Sound Shapes) or choose to jump straight into creation.

## Remixing & Sharing
More coming soon!

## Importing & Exporting
More coming soon!

## Beyond Digital
Take your blocks and run with them – Mixblocks is built from the ground up for use with hacker and maker tools like Arduino, LED Matrixes, etc. Write your own custom integrations, or grab from one that already exists.
