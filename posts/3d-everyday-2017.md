Here are some of my favorites from my first year of doing 3D!

Started exploring lighting and really pushing the film grain and chromatic aberration. This led to a few of my favorite pieces.

One of my favorite 3D images I ever created. There is something beautifully organic and alien about it.

My first day using Octane. It definitely had a huge effect on the aesthetic IÂ started exploring for the rest of the year.

Another one of my favorite materials. Love how natural the wear looks here.

I remember doing this piece the [day Chester passed.](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chester-benningtons-last-days-linkin-park-singers-mix-of-hope-heaviness-124862/) His music had such a huge impact on me growing up â€“ this was a pretty brutal loss for me.

Some day IÂ hope to make a whole series out of this piece â€“ This is the first time I started exploring more realistic interiors.

I think I lost the final render of this one, here is an in-progress one.

A couple slime explorations!

These were for a typography project I didn't end of finishing that IÂ would love to get back to some day.

I love beautiful texture in this material. One of my favorite materials I've made.
