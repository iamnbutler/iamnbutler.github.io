My wife is a huge Kingdom Hearts fan, so once I discovered that 3D printing metal was not only possible, but also not overly expensive, I decided I'd make her a custom Keyblade piece.

I'll try to remember to come back and post some of my exploratory sketches, but here is what the render looked like in the end:

These were rendered using C4D + Octane. I think a few of the materials are from one of the GSG material packs. I tend to make all my own metal materials though.

First I printed a cheap plastic copy to get a feel for the size and iterate on some small details.

I printed the final key through [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) and found a chain to match.
