I've been thinking about this over the past few years. The type of work I like to do and excel at tending to fall into a very specific portion of a project, and I found the further along a project got, the less efficient my time was and the less value I was producing. In contrast, the earlier I was into a project, the more efficient and valuable my contributions have been.

Recently I've been trying to align myself more with a role I've tentatively been calling Vision Design. I haven't spent much time yet researching what else is out there related to this term or how others use it yet, as I first want to process for myself what this means.‍

So here we go—Let's dive in and see what we find.

First, I'm writing this through the lens of someone that has worked under the title of "Product Designer" for the past 5 years. At Facebook we don't use level signifiers (senior, junior, principal, staff, etc) and like to call ourselves a flat organization (I have thoughts on this, but I digress.) The idea here is that everyone's contributions are equally valued—younger designers (experience wise) should have the chance to contribute equally as those with more experience. This is valuable to help people grow, and I personally experienced the value here as I had the chance to drive major projects myself (likely over my head even.)

The downside here is because everyone has the same role, generalists tend to do better than specialists because most projects are essentially owning an entire product or vertical. This is great for building a wide range of skills early, but as designers progress in their career they tend to specialize, and these specializations are often not rewarded equally.

In a metrics-based project environment like Facebook, specializations like designer/pm hybrids, systems designers align really well with the way projects work here. On the flip side, specialties like visual design, design engineering/prototyping & focuses on long range vision tend not to align as well with the way designers are rewarded. Sure, these things are seen as valuable, but people that want to do these things full time have a hard time finding a place, or continually find they are not measured equally with their peers.

I remember one of my peers being frustrated with their review one half. They were asked to lean heavily into long range vision in a long sprint and a series of follow up projects. They then were penalized at the end of the half, because they had not shipped enough work publicly/moved important internal metrics.

All of this means that people often end up in one of three categories: 1) an extremely experienced generalist, 2) moving to a manager track to progress in their career (even if they don't want manage people), or 3) leaving the company to find a place they can specialize the way they want.
