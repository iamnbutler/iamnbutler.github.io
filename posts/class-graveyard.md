<p>You know that thing you do when you get super hyped to learn something, open a million youtube videos, buy a class,
  get one session in and then completely move on?&nbsp;I do this a <strong>lot</strong>. This is a way to remind myself
  of all the cool things I've started that I&nbsp;forgot about or never went back to – and maybe (hopefully)&nbsp;let
  someone else know they are not alone in not being able to sit through a class!</p>
