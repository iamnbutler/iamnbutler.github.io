<p><em>Chapter Four —</em></p><p><em>In a world of design superstars it is easy to underestimate one's skills by misunderstanding the difference between talent and experience.</em></p><p>In my second year of university I had fallen in love with <a href="http://fantasy.co/">Fantasy Interactive</a>. I was just getting into web in a big way for the first time, and they were doing some of the hottest work out there. I remember the day they released the new USA Today site. I was blown away that they could make a news site so look so great. The interactions that they were coming up with were unlike things I had seen anywhere else on the web. I wanted to be them. I wanted to work there so badly. I remember going up to Anton Repponen to ask about internships. I don’t even remember what he said, all that mattered is that I had talked to him in person.</p><p>I didn’t wake up until I was given this advice from a friend: “Don’t fall in love with your idols. They just have had more time to work at it.” I had never really thought about the people behind the design that I had fallen in love with. Many of the people I look up to have been in the industry for ten years or more. Of course they have had more time to polish their skills. It can be hard to see that when looking at a fine crafted case study or newly launched site, but each of those designers came from the same place. They had to build up their skills over time.</p><p>While beginning the journey into the world of design it is inevitable to find designers to idolize. These discoveries can be creative fuel, but can also be a trap. Looking up to a designer without realizing that they just have more (or different) experience may make it seem like getting to the same point is unobtainable.</p><p>It is easy to fall into the trap of devaluing one's own work when constantly comparing with others.</p>
