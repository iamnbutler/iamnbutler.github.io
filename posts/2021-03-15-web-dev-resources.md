summary: >-
  I tend to go back to the same articles, tools and setups over and over when
  writing code. Now I'm passing them on, I hope you find something interesting!
edit: >-
  I'm a hobbiest myself, and I know opinions around tools and languages are
  strong in the dev space. These are my experiences an opinions, feel free to
  share yours!

## Tools
Text editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## CSS

- Of course, the classics: [CSSTricks' Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) & [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- In fact, pretty much [any guide](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) from [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/) & co is great.
- A [CSS grid](https://grid.layoutit.com/) tool (there are many!) These are super useful when trying to take the idea in your head and put it in a grid. This one is nice since you can create a codepen and modify it from there.
