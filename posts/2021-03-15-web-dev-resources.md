  I tend to go back to the same articles, tools and setups over and over when
  writing code. Now I'm passing them on, I hope you find something interesting!

  I'm a hobbiest myself, and I know opinions around tools and languages are
  strong in the dev space. These are my experiences and opinions, feel free to
  share yours!

## Preface
I'm mostly a hobby developer – I've learned mostly by taping together bits of code found all over the internet for years now. This space is mostly for remembering the cool and useful shit I run across, but hopefully you can find something useful in here!

## Tools
Text editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## CSS

- Of course, the classics: [CSSTricks' Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) & [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- In fact, pretty much [any guide](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) from [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/) & co is great.


### Grid

- A [CSS grid](https://grid.layoutit.com/) tool (there are many!) These are super useful when trying to take the idea in your head and put it in a grid. This one is nice since you can create a codepen and modify it from there.
- [Controlling leftover grid items](https://css-irl.info/controlling-leftover-grid-items/)
- [Complex CSS Grid layout in only a few lines](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/)

### Visual Assets & Art

- [CSS Doodle](https://css-doodle.com/) – Draw complex patterns & visuals in pure CSS.

## Static Site Generators

### [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

- [Build an eleventy site from scratch](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3)
- [11ty.rocks](https://11ty.rocks/) – Some great eleventy tips & beginner resources.
- [Use Airtable as a backend for an eleventy static site](https://danabyerly.com/articles/using-airtable-with-eleventy/)

## Git

- Questions:
	- [Remove .DS_Store from Git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository)

## Site Speed & Testing
