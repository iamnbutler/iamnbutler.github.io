Today we launched [a test of Facebook Avatars](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650685/facebook-avatar-messenger-newsfeed-bitmoji) publicly! I've been working on this for a long time now. I never would have imagined the complexity and amount of difficult decisions it takes to get a system like this off the ground. We have such a long way to go towards representing the incredibly diverse and special population of the world â€“ this is the first leg of the race, not crossing the finish line. I'm so incredibly proud of this team can't wait to see this product evolve over time.

My goal being at Facebook has always been to bring a bit of joy and fun into the world, and I hope this does that even a little for people.
