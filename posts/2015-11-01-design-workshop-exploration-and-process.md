## Context

Design Workshop is a year long research & independent study course in the YSDN program. Each student works with a professor to explore an area that is interesting to them and they can get quite deep into. This is an opportunity to go deep on a topic you are passionate about. 

I was severely burned out in my last year of school, so this project ended up taking shape as a sort of self reflection/introspective exploration of what design was to me and how my design process works. 

## Initial Approach
I had initially planned to do my workshop on the concept of telepresence in virtual reality. It was an exciting space at the time, and I had just got my DK2 shortly before so I was super excited to spend the year exploring. Somewhere along the line though my interest shifted.

## Pivot & Early Exploration

This week was all about exploring a new direction for my design workshop – Pivoting away from VR and telepresence to a more experimental approach. I'm not sure where this is going, but the things on my mind right now are lines, motion, voxels and mini scenes. Going to keep exploring and see where I land.

## Continued Exploration

It's been a few weeks of super deep exploration – I started working in a program called [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/), a simple 3D voxel program. It's been quite nice, because it is so simple it is easy to explore the more basic elements of design.

I'm becoming more attracted to explorations of light and reflection through creating mini scenes.

Here is some more recent imagery.

## Outcome
There were two outcomes from this project: A poster series and a site to host the partner written pieces. I'll share these in a later post.

## Process

Since this was such a large project, I thought I'd also upload some of the process that I worked on. This covers the projects transition all the way from VR and telepresence to an introspective about finding meaning in design through making.
