## Design Critique

- <https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/> – A great article on why critiques often feel broken, and a tactical approach to fix them.

## Culture

- <https://www.jessicaharllee.com/notes/good-challenges-vs-bad-challenges/>

## Reference

- <https://staff.design/> – Read about designers who chose to continue designing (known as an IC, or Individual contributor) at a high level rather than pursuing a manager track.
- <https://www.levels.fyi/> – Compare levels and salaries across companies.
