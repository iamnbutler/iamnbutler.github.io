Where is the line between responsibility and censorship? Like everything, this probably isn't a solid line but actually a gradation.

Working at FB this is something I think about constantly, especially since 2016. Joining Facebook as a stary-eyed new grad, I came in wanting to make the world a better place. My goal at FB has always been to bring a little bit of extra fun and joy to the world.

I don't have an answer to what the right solution is here – But my stance leans towards this leans towards this: Ultimately Facebook is a private platform, and I think we should do what we can to curb hate speech, threats of violence, and the spread of misinformation. I will always believe that we should foster conversation that moves the world toward being a better place. It's not for us to decide what is right and wrong, but that doesn't mean we can't have values and enforce them..

It's easy to sling accusations at anyone you can find that makes a decision that goes against what you believe. Virtue signaling is cheap.

Companies like Facebook are the size of a small city – there are a huge range of views and opinions here, and people of all sorts. Some people may genuinely be everything people say about us, but many people are trying their hardest to make positive change. I think more than anything it is important for those people to say and not go – They are the ones that bring positive chance.

It's not much, but it's what I feel I can do and say now.
