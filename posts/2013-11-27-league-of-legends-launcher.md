A sketch exploring some small improvements to the League of Legends game launcher.

## The Problem

There are a few easily addressable problems with the current launcher:
- It plays music when launched, and has no option to mute. Sometimes the volume is loud and you don't realize it, and this is super shocking. You end up either having to mute your system or listen to the music while the game patches. 
- On lower end machines the launcher animations can be a bit heavy, especially if you are doing something else at the same time.

## My Approach

I made a few improvements here, like being able to log in while the game is patching, disabling music, animations. I also took a visual pass across the whole launcher to be more stylistically consistent to where the game is going.

Beyond just the launcher, I started playing with what some of the tiles in the launcher could look like!

Thats it for now! I want to explore this a bit further in the future.
