I like to keep a running album of my creative inspiration throughout the year. It is cool to look back on overall, and I find I continue to pull from these references even years later.

My inspiration this year leaned heavily towards the 3D – I started learning 3D this year and was trying to absorb as much from others and the world around me as possible.

I didn't go a good enough job of tracking all my sources this year, I've started logging these as I go to make sure I can credit them in the future.
