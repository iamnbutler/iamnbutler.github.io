<p>We were supposed to make business cards to have available at our booths, but I decided since I&nbsp;already had a job and wasn't really looking for new connections, instead I would use the space to hopefully share a little joy.</p><p>These cards were printed with a spot gloss, so the gradient squares were super rich (I'll have to take some photos later to add to this post.)</p><p>On the backs of the cards I&nbsp;added little quotes I found that I liked.</p><p>Overall the cards didn't have much of a point, I just wanted to have something that people could take that looked nice.</p>
