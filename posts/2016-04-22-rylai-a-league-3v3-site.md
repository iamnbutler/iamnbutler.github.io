  Ryl.ai is a concept project that I worked on to fill the place of some of the
  major League 3V3 sites that shut down. The idea was to get people excited
  about the game mode through easy access to streams, strategies and stats, in
  the vein of something like champion.gg.

Ryl.ai is a concept project that I worked on to fill the place of some of the major League 3V3 sites (like thetwistedtreeline & 3v3.gg) that shut down. The idea was to get people excited about the game mode through easy access to streams, strategies and stats, in the vein of something like [champion.gg](https://champion.gg/).

## The Concept
I was super excited to start building this, as IÂ was very deep into 3v3 laddering with a team of friends. We were averaging a few hundred games a year at the time and making steady progress, but we were starting to hit a wall.

A big part of the League experience is using resources to learn champions and strategies in depth, but there was a real lack of these resources for 3v3. I wanted to make a truly dedicated site that got people hyped about it and helped bring it back into the spotlight.

The hypothesis was that people would come here and learn to play their champions better, learn new team comps with their teams & track their stats to get better.

## The Site

We planned to have a few sections:
- Home would overview stats for the weeks, a hype reel of the best plays of that month, and a featured streams that were currently live. Beyond that people would pivot right into choosing the champion they wanted to improve.
- Champions would be a deep dive into each champion strong in 3v3, with a dynamic tier list and recommended champions for different skill levels and focuses. This would be more opinionated than a simple stat list.
- Team Comps â€“ Especially in a game mode as small and fast as 3v3, team comps are especially important. Here we would highlight strong team comps, and have a team comp finder based on what you and your team mates play. We could even go as far as to recommend champions for team members to learn to open up stronger comps to your team.
- Stats would cover your personal stats and recommend growth areas.
- Streams would highlight 3v3 streamers, and recommend smaller streamers in balance with popular ones. People could stream to tags as well, like a tag focused around getting laddering feedback. Some issues with streaming ladder games emerge, so we would need to tackle these.

One of the big ideas I was excited about was a community-driven monthly highlight reel to expose people to new players, cool plays and new strategies.

## The Champion Page

The individual champion pages were going to be designed from the perspective of learning and growing while picking up a new champion or refining your current skill set.

I didn't get super far on these designs, but a few cool things:
- The chart in the header of a champion page would show their overall popularity in 3v3.
- Individual champions would have a community built hype reel to show off some of the cool moments from that champion.
- Having entire length "pro games" available to watch let people learn things they might have missed otherwise from general guides, like things they might do in the early game or in team fights.
- Videos of more advanced techniques with written explanations to go along with them.

Overall, the differentiator here between these champion pages (and ryl.ai in general) was to go beyond a simple stats page, but be more objective and provide more perspectives than a guide written by one person. They would offer value to all tiers of skill ideally.

## The Outcome

As with many of these projects, I got quite busy and it tapered off, and many tools jumped in to fill this niche for other game modes â€“ Sadly Twisted Treeline was [removed](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Treeline) from League of Legends in 2019 at the end of Season 9 ðŸ˜¢
