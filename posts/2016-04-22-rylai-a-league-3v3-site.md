<p>Ryl.ai was a site I&nbsp;was super excited to start working on, as I&nbsp;was very deep into 3v3 laddering with a team of friends. We were averaging a few hundred games a year at the time (which was huge for us) and making steady progress. There were a few resource sites for the much neglected Twisted Treeline map, but I wanted to make a truly dedicated site that got people hyped about it and helped bring it back into the spotlight.</p><p>The hypothesis was that people would come here and learn to play their champions better, learn new team comps with their teams &amp; track their stats to get better.</p><p>As with many of these projects, I got quite busy and it tapered off, and many tools jumped in to fill this niche – Sadly I don't think Twisted Treeline even exists anymore.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2616px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bbeb294938f3d44f9bcc5_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%2011.13.43%20AM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2610px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bbf594ff35756f3906d3f_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%2011.13.53%20AM.png" loading="lazy"></div></figure>
