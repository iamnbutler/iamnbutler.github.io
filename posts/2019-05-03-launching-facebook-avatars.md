<p>Today we launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650685/facebook-avatar-messenger-newsfeed-bitmoji">a test of Facebook Avatars</a> publicly! I've been working on this for a long time now. I never would have imagined the complexity and amount of difficult decisions it takes to get a system like this off the ground. We have such a long way to go towards representing the incredibly diverse and special population of the world â€“ this is the first leg of the race, not crossing the finish line. I'm so incredibly proud of this team can't wait to see this product evolve over time.</p><p>My goal being at Facebook has always been to bring a bit of joy and fun into the world, and I hope this does that even a little for people.</p>
