title: Me on the Web
subtitle: A peak into my sketchbooks as I look back at all the directions I've
  explored for my personal site.
summary: I have many, many, many times explored new directions for my personal
  site. (My record of new direction to launched site is pretty abysmal, maybe
  10:1 T__T) Those designs end up just living in a folder somewhere, so I wanted
  to give them a place to live here. It's cool to look back over the years at
  all the different directions, and watch the trends come and go.

\[2012] The oldest concept I can find, but I know there are a few others. This was a simple approach. My title for this one was "Full Stack Web Developer." I think around this time I had been contemplating leaving design and going eng full time.

\[2013ish~] I quite liked this one – More of a splash page than a full site, but I was happy with it. I'll always remember this one because someone lifted it 1:1 and didn't even update the image links (there was a hover image asset that was hosted in my dropbox!) We brainstormed all sorts of fun ways we could mess with them.

Another simple direction.

\[2015] Super corporate feeling. Glad I never built this! Doesn't match my vibe well.

\[2015] Simple again.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bbb18c2e0fa38d3c3262b_v4-d1.png)

\[2015] And something completely different!

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bba84983bbbf5ca688cfe_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%2010.55.58%20AM.png)

\[2015] A much more editorial approach. I was writing a lot at this time, so it make sense.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bbb3c4ff35771de905edd_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%2011.00.03%20AM.png)

More mobile first (I've lost a lot of these fonts, so things look pretty off.)

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bbb590e0fb42da5ec0730_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%2011.00.21%20AM.png)

\[2015] Probably the 5th or 6th direction I worked on this year. Lots of time designing websites to avoid doing class work :) (2015?)

There is about a 2-3 year gap here. I'm sure there are some other concepts between these – I'll have to try to dig them up.

\[2019] A tablet-first approach focused on themed project tiles.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bda957f9d024fed9920ab_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.11.32%20PM.png)

I thought this footer was pretty cool (a bit busy but...)

\[2019] Dark simple direction. I was working on this one but realized I pulled inspo a bit too directly from another site I saw. Didn't feel great launching this one.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdaf3ec4a8283ba115281_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.12.21%20PM.png)

\[2019] Evolving the above two concepts together.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdb08d36352cfc56f0fab_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.12.47%20PM.png)

A project page concept.

There were some cool details here, like custom image h-scrolls do dive deep on a particular part of a project.

\[2020] More evolution.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdb52e37b94ea500a2f92_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.13.51%20PM.png)

About direction. (IMO this was a bit much for me. Content is example copy.)

Project Tile WIPs from the above few concepts.

\[2020] A fun departure from the other styles I'd been exploring. This was a sketch of a game level approach, with fun elements like a themed day/night cycle, experience bar based on years of experience, and more :)

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdbf97f9d0275859923a9_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.15.42%20PM.png)

\[2020] Ended up simplifying down quite a bit. I like the blueprint-y feeling of this direction.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdc1b2ba0d679dc12a6e9_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.16.45%20PM.png)

Blowing it out further.

This is closest to my site as of writing this, but It will continue to evolve I'm sure!

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604bdc637a2c856e887b0ab7_Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%201.25.48%20PM.png)

\[2021] Already thinking about how I can iterate on this direction to bring it a bit more to life, with more depth and a bit more character.
