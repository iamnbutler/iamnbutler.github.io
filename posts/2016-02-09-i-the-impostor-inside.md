# Chapter One

_Everyone has felt that creeping feeling. The feeling that you just couldn’t possibly belong. That somehow you are here by mistake. It’s terrifying because it feels_ **_true_**_._

There is a voice inside of me. One that constantly tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.

The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. _You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers._ Even while I read stories of many great people who have struggled with Impostor Syndrome, I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what their experiences.

My struggles with self value make me feel like I’m not meant to be here.

In my early years of post-secondary education I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy my classes as I felt like I was learning more on my own, and yet, I saw the skill gap between my friends and I widen. That gap became a chasm. I no longer belonged, and missed out on many opportunities.

I was afraid to apply to internships, and unwilling to leave my job to search for something more challenging. I was afraid I was already working over my level and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I feared that my lack of skills would be exposed.

_Afraid, afraid, afraid._

## The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.

Well — I’m here to tell you that there is hope. You are **not** an impostor.

You did not end up here by accident.

You don’t have to give in to the voice in your head, and here is how you are going to prove it:

*   **Trust others.** _Trust that they know what they are doing. You were hired for this job for a reason. You made it into that school for a reason. By doubting yourself you are doubting everyone involved in the process. And for the people that trusted you, create something good!_
*   **Break the cycle.** _Every time you feel like you don’t belong reflect on your accomplishments. Tell yourself that you do belong, and that you are here for a reason. Take joy in finding what that reason is and working towards accomplishing it._
*   **Challenge yourself**. _Don’t shy away from a problem or learning a skill because it takes you out of your comfort zone. You deserve to contribute. Let the world know what you want to say._
*   **Confide in others.** _You might be surprised at how many people feel the same way. Encourage each other. Sometimes simply verbalizing your thoughts can help you see things differently._
*   **Be confident.** _Don’t place your value in other’s opinions of you. Even the positive opinions of others can cripple your self confidence. Julie Zhou said it best in her article_ [The Impostor Syndrome](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88#.aecfyy60n): _“Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear… \[however\] it gets easier. You start trusting yourself. You’re an imposter less and less, and you’re yourself more and more.”_

When the voice inside you starts whispering, remember that you are here for a reason. You were not chosen by mistake.

You worked hard, struggled long and now you have made it to the place you belong.
