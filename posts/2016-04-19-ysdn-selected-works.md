summary: >+
  I spent a lot of time during school doing professional work, so I often took
  my courses as an opportunity to explore and experiment with mediums. Learning
  to work in a variety of spaces and mediums allows one to grow and appreciate
  voices different than their own. Understanding alternate viewpoints and
  another’s worldview can be found at the core of becoming a more open person.
