Where is the line between responsibility and censorship? Like everything, this probably isn't a solid line but actually more of a gradation.

Working at FB this is something I think about constantly, especially since the outcome of 2016. Joining Facebook as a starry-eyed new grad, I came in wanting to make the world a better place. My goal at FB has always been to bring a little bit of extra fun and joy to the world. Little did I know what I was getting myself in to.

I don't have an answer to what the right solution is here – But my stance leans towards this leans towards this: Ultimately Facebook is a private platform, and I think we should do what we can proactively to curb hate speech, threats of violence, and the spread of misinformation. I will always believe that we should foster conversation that moves the world toward being a better place. It's not for us to decide what is right and wrong, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have values. I realize it isn't this simple, however. I believe by treating companies like FB, Twitter the same as speech we inadvertently create a false equivalence between the two.

It's easy to sling accusations at anyone you can find that makes a decision that goes against what you believe. Employees are often targets of hate by all sides of this argument. Virtue signaling is cheap.

Companies like Facebook are the size of a small city – there are a huge range of views and opinions here, and people of all sorts. Some people may genuinely be everything people say, but many people are trying their hardest to make positive change. I think more than anything it is important for those people to stay and not go – They are the ones that bring positive chance.

I think we have a long, long way to go in this space, and the edges of speech on social media will continue to be pushed. As I said above, I don't have a solution here but I think we have to continue to try rather than absolve any say in what is on our platforms. 

It's not much, but it's what I feel I can say now.

My Original Tweet Text for context:

\> I've shared others posts, but I need to be clear–FB is on the wrong side of this and I can't support their stance. Doing nothing isn't Being Bold. Many of us feel this way.
