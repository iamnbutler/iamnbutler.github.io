Always seek the advice of a <strong><em>mental health professional</em></strong> or other qualified <strong><em>health provider </em></strong><em>for any health questions.</em><br></p><p>As someone who has a hard time disconnecting emotions from a situation I can relate closely to the example given at the beginning of Alison Wood Brook’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/emotion-and-the-art-of-negotiation"><em>Emotion and the Art of Negotiation</em></a><em>. </em>In fact, the reason I decided to join a large company despite having skills that align better with a startup environment is I don’t like having to interact directly with clients. Negotiation and conflict are sources of anxiety for me personally, which is an emotion I try to avoid when possible as it has acted as a gateway into more difficult situations for me in the past.</p><p>I’m the type of person that is willing to pay more money for a service to avoid interacting with someone that cause a conflict. I often feel cheated in negotiations as I am not willing to attack the opposite parties footing to make them feel less comfortable to get myself in a better position. At the same time I am not naïve–I understand often that I am being taken advantage of in these situations or will come out with a result that is less desirable for myself. Similar to some of the advice in the article, I attempt to familiarize myself with a situation and the people involved before I have to negotiate. I try to act comfortable and casual around those people so that I do not make myself anxious, and if necessary bring in an expert to negotiate in my place.</p><p>The section on “Preparing Your Emotional Strategy” in the article provides a useful overview of some of the steps to take when preparing for negotiation. Since in the past I have spent a fair amount of time avoiding conflict &amp; negotiation I will need to remind myself of these strategies as they come about again, as being able to navigate the negotiation is an important skill to have. I think it is often possible to reach a common ground in which neither party needs to feel that they have ‘lost’ the negotiation, and that by taking such an approach a connection can be made for further business and interaction. (Essentially, don’t burn your bridges.)</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>
