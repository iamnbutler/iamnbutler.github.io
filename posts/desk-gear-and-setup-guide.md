<h3>Overview + Methodology</h3>
<p>
  I've always been a huge tech nerd and a bit of a spendaholic, so I've compiled together a list of all the high quality
  desk/work from home gear I've used or know of in one place (so you don't have to waste money on things that are not
  great!) This is the list I&nbsp;wish I had when I started building my setup!
</p>
<p>
  These will skew towards the higher price range in these categories, but I'll try to include any budget options I know
  that are solid, or I've personally tested. Generally, I'm looking at a balance of quality, aesthetic and price range.
  I'll call out anything in this list that I&nbsp;haven't personally owned or used.

<h3>Computer</h3>
<p>You probably already have on of these, but in case you are shopping around, here is what I recommend in 2021.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h5>Macs</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air">Macbook Air M1</a></p>
<p>
  This is a beast of a machine, and the new M1 chip seems to be more or less living up to it's hype. This is a great
  machine for most things – If you don't need to be running productivity or content creation software (Adobe, video
  editing,
  etc) you probably don't need much more than this. Be aware that the SSDs in these machines can't be upgraded, so you
  will need to buy the size you need up front.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">Macbook Pro</a></p>
<p>
  These days, it isn't really worth moving up to a Macbook Pro unless you are doing some heavy creation work. Even
  design work can be done completely on the above M1 Air due to Figma and other web tools coming on to the scene. If you
  do
  need an MBP, don't buy a model made between 2016-2020 (these have the terrible older MBP&nbsp;keyboards.)
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a></p>
<p>
  If you don't need to be on the go with your machine, and want to combine in a monitor, iMacs are great. I miss mine
  all the time. I'd maybe recommend waiting though, as I imagine we'll get an
  <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac refresh </a>pretty soon.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h5>PC – Laptop</h5>
<p>
  These move so fast it is hard to keep up with. If you are looking to buy a laptop, I recommend <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw">Dave2D's</a> channel. He covers most notable ones in
  a straightforward and
  unbiased way. Otherwise, when in doubt, usually the <a
    href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop">XPS 13</a> is a good bet.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h5>PC – Desktop</h5>
<p>
  Generally your best bet will be to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-build-pc-ultimate-step-step-guide">put
    together a machine yourself</a>, but in 2021 this is a bit of a tall ask due to shortages being everywhere.
  I&nbsp;picked up<a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/magnus-one-ecm73070c-barebone"> one of these</a>
  recently for our living room – it's an awesome little powerhouse (that makes a lot of noise.)&nbsp;The main thing to
  remember with PCs:&nbsp;smaller = more money, faster = more money, high end = mostly for bragging rights. Use a tool
  like <a href="https://www.logicalincrements.com/">logical increments</a> to find the right price/performance ratio for
  you.

<h3>Monitor</h3>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 1144px;">
  <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605fead99a7d3d0e03fa18c3_HMUB2.jpeg"
      alt="Inline - 1" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D24BQBQ/">LG UltraFine 5K </a>– LG</p>
<p>~850-1,299 (Price varies by sales +&nbsp;New vs Refurbished) – <a
    href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/LG-UltraFine-Monitor-MacBook-Renewed/product/B07D24BQBQ">Price History</a></p>
<p>
  Not sure what the poor reviews are about here – I&nbsp;bought mine out of pocket (refurbished), I've been driving this
  monitor for 3 years now and it's been solid. If you are using a Mac, use your laptop open with a monitor, and
  on-screen
  color matters then this is the best option.
</p>
<p>Options open up a bit more if you are willing to have non-OSX&nbsp;native color (this isn't overly noticeable as long
  as you don't use your laptop open, or are using a desktop like a Mac Mini.)</p>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 1000px;">
  <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605fee042dfa607dc8b65bda_ew3270u-front.png"
      width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HWBGH5/">BenQ EW3270U</a> (32", 4K) – BenQ</p>
<p>
  Matte display, super large, not for games. I've daily drove these for a few years now, and own two of them. IMO two of
  these are too big for a desk. If you want something pretty solid and are ok with slightly muted colors these are a
  pretty good place to start. You probably want to arm mount these. (Make sure you are ok with how big they are.)
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>Smaller monitor for VC</p>
<p>
  I&nbsp;don't have a specific recommendation here, as most of these are from generic brands, but having a small
  (13~15")&nbsp;portable monitor for second screen things like music, as well as a dedicate VC is pretty handy. Ideally
  one with
  VESA compatible mounting holes is ideal (like
  <a
    href="https://www.banggood.com/PORPOISE-HT-1330XT-13_3-Inch-1080P-Type-C-Portable-Computer-Monitor-Gaming-Display-Screen-for-Smartphone-Tablet-Laptop-Game-Consoles-p-1666109.html?p=1D22009628395201703K&custlinkid=1507010&cur_warehouse=CN">
    this
  </a>
  one) so you can put it on a monitor arm or VESA&nbsp;stand. Your webcam/mic/etc can also sit on top of this to get a
  better angle.
</p>
<p>Something like a <a href="https://portal.facebook.com/products/">Portal</a> can also work here if you want a flexible
  dedicated calling device. (Downside:&nbsp;Not mountable.)</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/select-airpods">Airpods</a>/<a
    href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro">Airpods Pro</a> – Apple</p>
<p>Price:&nbsp;$149/$249</p>
<p>
  I've tried a ton of headphones, and honestly, for meetings and passive listening, nothing really beats the Airpods.
  Obviously sound quality isn't the priority here, but the device switching connivence and auto pause when removing a
  single
  side is great. I prefer the shape of the regular Airpods over the pros, and actually prefer that they don't noise
  cancel. If you need noise cancelling to work, go with the Pros.
</p>
<p>I think the wireless charging case is a big of a gimmick.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 912px;">
  <div><img
      src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605fef79116d4778b77f6298_71WNWRLJCsL._AC_SL1500_.jpeg"
      width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/">AT ATH-M50X</a> – Audio-Technica</p>
<p>Price:&nbsp;~$120</p>
<p>
  The classic. You probably know at least one person with pair of headphones or have seen someone on TV wearing them,
  and for a good reason. These are great, solid, unoffensive headphones. "Neutral"&nbsp;describes their sound well. If
  you
  need something reasonably priced, and high quality, these is a good place to start. There are tons of detailed reviews
  on the amazon page, so I won't write much more here. (Note:&nbsp;Some people in the reviews recommend trying
  after-market ear cups on these. I&nbsp;haven't done this on either pair of these that I&nbsp;have, but could be good
  to look in to.)
</p>
<p>There is apparently a bluetooth version of these available now – I can't speak to them but they might be worth trying
  out.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 330px;">
  <div><img
      src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605fefe99a0fa5dcf29ca514_eb0062b3db03748efc7f5ca3fd82ccc5.jpeg"
      width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3">WH-1000XM3</a> – Sony</p>
<p>Price: $349</p>
<p>These are the ones I own – I'm not sure why the XM4s are both cheaper (~$250) and have worse reviews, but these are
  pretty good. (Gross note:&nbsp;These ear cups tend to gather sweat a decent amount when worn for a few hours.)</p>
<p>While I bought these for working at my desk, the real place they shine is on long flights. With the noise cancelling
  on you basically forget anyone else is on the plane with you. It more or less completely removes cabin noise.</p>
<p>Overall, if you are just using these as desk headphones, I'd go either cheaper and wired, or with the Airpod Pros.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://gouppercase.com/products/zero">Uppr Zero headphone stand</a>.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;don't own this one, but this is a pretty unique &amp;&nbsp;beautiful headphone stand with an all aluminum
  build.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Video</h3>
<h5>Lower End</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001087.html?crid=34">Logitech
    C922 Pro</a> – <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/webcams">Logitech</a></p>
<p>~$100</p>
<p>This is a pretty unoffensive option for a starter webcam. For most cases, this will give you an upgrade to your video
  and audio quality without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Also promising:</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483">Software</a> +&nbsp;A Phone</p>
<p>
  This is becoming a more popular option, and the results are pretty good. You can get high quality video out of your
  phone that you might already have. It can be a bit of a hassle to set up and take down your phone daily, but it is an
  option.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/">Moment</a> has also been kicking off a promising <a
    href="https://www.shopmoment.com/magsafe">Magsafe line</a> for mounting. This might be helpful with this type of
  approach.</p>
<h5>Higher End</h5>
<p>DSLR/Mirrorless +&nbsp;Capture Card</p>
<p>Price range:&nbsp;<em>~$300 all the way to $3K+</em></p>
<p>What most people you see with "amazing" looking video quality/youtube videos are using. There are a few good options
  here:</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">Pi HD&nbsp;Cam</a> – <a
    href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Rasberry Pi</a></p>
<p>
  This is a pretty cool +&nbsp;hacker friendly option. The lenses it uses are inexpensive CCTV&nbsp;lenses as well. I'm
  hoping to write up a post on creating a VC&nbsp;setup using the Rasberry Pi at some point, so I'll revisit this then!
</p>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 1500px;">
  <div><img
      src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605f8ca7465d7152aa40afa9_daskeyboard-4-professional-front-view.jpeg"
      loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/">Das Professional 4 Keyboard</a> – <a
    href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/">daskeyboard</a></p>
<p>
  This keyboard checks all the boxes for me – Not visually loud, has quite options for mechanical keys, physical knob
  for volume, media controls... You get the picture. The one thing that would make this keyboard perfect for me is a mic
  mute button, but I&nbsp;know that is asking a lot. I use the Cherry MX brown version, but if you want something
  louder/more clicky you can go with Blues.
</p>
<p>This keyboard also has a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/">Windows version</a>, and a
  <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/">blank key version</a>.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 1200px;">
  <div><img
      src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605f8d06e5454a35241cd0e4_61q9r49nQ8L._AC_SY450_.jpg"
      loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E8KO2B0/">Generic Brand Mechanical</a></p>
<p>~$30-50</p>
<p>
  A super budget option – I was pretty impressed with this keyboard, Great form factor. Keys are mushy, so if that bugs
  you I would avoid this one. I actually like the feel of these keys over many higher-end mechanical keyboards. I'd
  expect
  a 1-2 year lifespan out of something like this, and no support if something goes wrong.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Mouse</h3>
<p>Mice are highly debatable, like keyboards, so I'll just share what I have used.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 767px;">
  <div>
    <img
      src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605f8d3e7e766a2bba23f678_https%253A%252F%252Fhybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net%252Fsys-master-phoenix-images-container%252Fhbc%252Fh0f%252F9081448529950%252Frazer-deathadder-v2-gallery-hero-1500x1000.jpeg"
      alt="Razer DeathAdder V2" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" />
  </div>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/Razer-DeathAdder-V2/RZ01-03210100-R3U1">Razer Death Adder</a> – Razer</p>
<p>Price:&nbsp;~$50-$130 (Depending on features.)</p>
<p>
  A solid daily driver – Some people rag on Razer but I've been using one model or another of the death adder since 2008
  and they have always served me well. I'd expect to replace these every 2-3 years (the build is solid, but they often
  end up double clicking randomly later in their life, similar to a common issue with Logitech mice.)
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h5>Specialized</h5>
<p>SpaceMouse Pro 3D – 3DConnexion</p>
<p>
  This mouse is for 3D work primarily – if you do a lot of 3D modeling, and can get used to the idea of physically
  navigating 3D&nbsp;space, this will be a HUGE time saver for you. I&nbsp;never could get into the right mental mode to
  navigate like this, but I was very impressed with the device itself.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>Macro Pads (Example: <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Tartarus-Progammable-Detachable-Mecha-Membrane/dp/B07754PYFK/">Razer
    Tartarus</a>)</p>
<p>
  There is a huge variety of these, but if your workflow would benefit for a place to map macros, these could be useful.
  I haven't use this specific one, but in my experience Razer's software for mapping macros is pretty straight forward.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Mousepads &amp;&nbsp;Desk Covers</h3>
<p>
  I&nbsp;haven't found my perfect mouse pad yet, but I&nbsp;tend to prefer large, desk cover style ones that the
  keyboard also sits on. This avoids the awkwardness and physical wear of dragging your arm over the edge of the mouse
  pad
  occasionally, and also looks better. I've bought a few of these from Amazon in the past few years, but nothing has
  really stood out.
</p>
<p>I'll probably try one of these next:</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://grovemade.com/product/matte-desk-pad/?initial=534">Matte Desk Pad</a> – Grovemade</p>
<p>
  I haven't owned this particular desk pad, but I feel comfortable enough with Grovemade's other products to recommend
  this one blind. I'd personally avoid the wool ones, I&nbsp;have one of those and I tend to find it a bit scratchy on
  the
  skin while mousing around but YMMV.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a
    href="https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/orbitkey-desk-mat/products/orbitkey-desk-mat?variant=32750570471520">Orbitkey
    Desk Mat</a> – Orbitkey</p>
<p>Price:&nbsp;$65</p>
<p>I haven't owned this one either, but it looks pretty solid, and the cable holder is a big plus to me.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Monitor Stands, Arms &amp;&nbsp;Risers</h3>
<p><a href="https://grovemade.com/product/wood-desk-shelf/?initial=342">Wood Desk Shelf</a> – <a
    href="https://grovemade.com/">Grovemade</a></p>
<p><a href="https://grovemade.com/product/wood-laptop-riser/?initial=622">Wood Laptop Riser </a>– <a
    href="https://grovemade.com/">Grovemade</a></p>
<p>I'll bundle these together, but overall Grovemade has excellent desktop accessories, including stands. The desk shelf
  will comfortably fit 2 large-ish monitors (~27in), and you can slide your keyboard or laptop underneath.</p>
<p>The laptop riser adds quite a bit of height, so you would want this to sit beside a monitor, and a keyboard/mouse–not
  use it full time.</p>
<p>The quality of Grovemade products overall are top tier, and I know a lot of people that have these. You probably
  won't regret investing in these.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 1920px;">
  <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/605f8de259cb0e29d9ef56a1_TS3-Plus-12A.jpeg"
      width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" /></div>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/">CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock</a> – <a
    href="https://www.caldigit.com/">CalDigit</a></p>
<p>(~$230+)</p>
<p>
  If you buy a single high end accessory for your desk, this is the one I would recommend. Flawless connectivity across
  multiple monitors, high quality USB, card reader and full power even for 16" 100W Macbook Pros. I've used my for the
  past 4 years and I've never had a single issue with it, and know at least 15 people who all have had a similar
  experience. This is the baseline for high quality tech
</p>
<p>Caldigit has a few other options these days for docks – you can see if a different one meets your needs better, but I
  do recommend something with it's own power source, not something that pulls power from the laptop.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pikatea.com/collections/products/products/pikatea-macropad-gb2">Under desk volume knob and macro
    keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>
  I&nbsp;haven't had a chance to try this yet, but I've been looking to buy something like this for years. The keys act
  as a bindable macro keyboard, and the knob works by default for volume and mute/unmute. Looking forward to picking one
  of these up to see if I can turn it into a VC&nbsp;controller.
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p><a href="https://en.yeelight.com/product/1512.html">Yeelight – LED&nbsp;Light Bar Pro</a>.</p>
<p>This sits on top of your monitor and illuminates the whole desk surface evenly without adding glare to the monitor.
  I&nbsp;plan on buying this model, so I'll update this once I&nbsp;try it myself.</p>

<h3>Wifi/Networking</h3>
<p>Ethernet</p>
<p>If you don't have a dock with Ethernet, at least some sort of small USB-C to Ethernet dongle is a must have (<a

    Grommet USB&nbsp;Hub

</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool idea – I&nbsp;already use grommet holes to run cables from the top of my desk to the bottom,
  adding a hub here for things like headphones and quick USB&nbsp;access is pretty handy.</p>

<p>‍</p>
<h2>General Thoughts</h2>
<h3>Buying from Amazon</h3>
<p>
  If you have a shopping history with them, buy though Amazon where possible. Their customer support generally will fix
  problems no questions asked, and often on lower priced items not even have you send them back Always look for the
  Prime
  tag, avoid buying from Amazon Marketplace accounts or items tagged "Fulfilled by Amazon."
</p>
<p>Expect buying through Amazon you will eventually get a returned item.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Credit Card Perks</h3>
<p>
  This really depends on what you have access to, but a high end credit card like a <a
    href="https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/sapphire/reserve">Sapphire Reserve</a> will not only
  protect you against fraud, but also protect
  you against accidental damage. When we bought our <a
    href="https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65gxpua-oled-4k-tv">LG&nbsp;GX 65</a> I cracked it when wall mounting it.
  Chase replaced the TV for us under their accidental damage policy (Caps
  out at ~10k.) Lower tier cards like Chase Sapphire Preferred can offer up to ~1k in accidental damage as well.
