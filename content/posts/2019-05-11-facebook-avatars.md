Today Facbook launched [a test of Facebook Avatars](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650685/facebook-avatar-messenger-newsfeed-bitmoji) publicly! I worked on Avatars for around 2.5 years, so it is exciting to see it finally getting into the wild.

I never would have imagined the complexity and amount of difficult decisions it takes to get a system like this off the ground. I have a lot of respect for all the teams out there working on likeness systems for people. 

We have such a long way to go towards representing the incredibly diverse and special population of the world, and I wish we could have won more of the fights towards further representation towards disabilities before launching. 

However, this is the first leg of the race, not crossing the finish line. I'm so incredibly proud of this team and can't wait to see this product evolve over time.

Even before I joined, this was the project I wanted to start. I believe that the unique position that Facebook is in makes a virtual identity a powerful thing if done responsibly. From adding an extra layer of expression to people's content to giving people safety to post what they want in places they can't show their faces, Avatars can unlock new ways for people to use Facebook that enriches their lives. My goal being at Facebook has always been to bring a bit of joy and fun into the world, and I hope this does that even a little for people.
