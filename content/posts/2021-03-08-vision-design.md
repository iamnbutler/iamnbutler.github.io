I've been thinking about this over the past few years. The type of work I like to do and excel attends to fall into a very specific portion of a project, and I found the further along a project got, the less efficient my time was and the less value I was producing. In contrast, the earlier I was into a project, the more efficient and valuable my contributions have been.

Recently I've been trying to align myself more with a role I've tentatively been calling Vision Design. I haven't spent much time yet researching what else is out there related to this term or how others use it yet, as I first want to process for myself what this means.‍

So here we go—Let's dive in and see what we find.

First, I'm writing this through the lens of someone that has worked under the title of "Product Designer" for the past 5 years.

At Facebook, we don't use level signifiers (senior, junior, principal, staff, etc) and like to call ourselves a flat organization (I have thoughts on this, but I digress.) The idea here is that everyone's contributions are equally valued—younger designers (experience-wise) should have the chance to contribute equally as those with more experience. This is valuable to help people grow, and I personally experienced the value here as I had the chance to drive major projects myself (likely over my head even.)

The downside here is that because everyone has the same role, generalists tend to do better than specialists because, in most projects, they essentially own an entire product or vertical. This is great for building a wide range of skills early, but as designers progress in their careers, they tend to specialize, and these specializations are often not rewarded equally.

In a metrics-based project environment like Facebook, specializations like designer/pm hybrids, systems designers align really well with the way projects work here. On the flip side, specialties like visual design, design engineering/prototyping & focus on long-range vision tend not to align with the way designers are rewarded.

Sure, these things are seen as valuable, but people who want to do these things full time have a hard time finding a place or continually finding they are not measured equally with their peers. Or they are expected to do the same amount of work as a generalist, simply with their specialization added on top.

I remember one of my peers being frustrated with their review one-half after they were asked to lean heavily into long-range vision in a long sprint and a series of follow-up projects. They then were penalized at the end of the half, because they had not shipped enough work publicly/moved important internal metrics.

All of this means that people often end up in one of three categories:

1. An extremely experienced generalist.

2. Moving to a manager track to progress in their career (even if they don't want to manage people).

3. Leaving the company to find a place they can specialize the way they want.

(I didn't end up finishing this writing, but quite a few months later, my wrap-up take is this: Facebook wasn't a good place to pursue the types of work I wanted to do and doesn't reward certain kinds of specialists. I've discussed this with many people who left for similar reasons and got similar feedback from all of them. I think Facebook and other large generalist-focused companies should find a way for specialists to shine and foster their growth.)
