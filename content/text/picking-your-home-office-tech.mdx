In the first part of this series, we'll take a look at all the hardware you might want when setting up your desk. We'll cover computers, peripherals, VC gear & audio, and more. In the later parts, we'll cover desk setup, ergonomics, and software!

## The Gear

I've compiled together a list of all the high-quality desk/work from home gear I've used or know of in one place (so you don't have to waste money on things that are not great!) This is the list I wish I had when I started building my setup!

These will skew towards the higher price range in these categories, but I'll try to include any budget options I know that are solid or I've personally tested. Generally, I'm looking at a balance of quality, aesthetic, and price range.

I'll try to call out anything in this list that I haven't personally owned or used.

### Computer

You probably already have one of these, but in case you are shopping around, here is what I recommend in 2021.

##### Macs

**_Edit: This was written before the M1X was launched. Don't invest in an M1 device over an M1X, even if it is a good amount cheaper._**

[Macbook Air M1](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air)

This is a beast of a machine, and the new M1 chip seems to be more or less living up to its hype. This is an excellent machine for most things – If you don't need to be running productivity or content creation software (Adobe, video editing, etc.) you probably don't need much more than this. Be aware that the SSDs in these machines can't be upgraded, so you will need to buy the size you need upfront.

Note: If you plan to have more than one monitor or to run a monitor at 4K, I'd think about moving up to a...

[Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/)

These days, it isn't really worth moving up to a Macbook Pro unless you are doing some heavy creation work. Even design work can be done completely on the above M1 Air due to Figma and other web tools coming onto the scene. If you do need an MBP, don't buy a model made between 2016-2020 (these have the terrible [older MBP keyboards](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-designA).)

[iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac/)

If you don't need to be on the go with your machine and want to combine in a monitor, iMacs are great. I honestly my good old iMac all the time.

If an iMac sounds good, I'd maybe recommend waiting, though, as I imagine we'll likely get an [iMac refresh](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/) pretty soon.

##### PC – Laptop

These move so fast it is hard to keep up with. If you are looking to buy a laptop, I recommend [Dave2D's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw) channel. He covers the most notable ones in a straightforward and unbiased way.

Otherwise, when in doubt, usually the [XPS 13](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop) is a good bet. Generally, [Razer Blades](https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade) have an ok track record, but they are a bit more hit or miss than the XPS 13.

##### PC – Desktop

Generally, your best bet will be to [put together a machine yourself](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-build-pc-ultimate-step-step-guide), but in 2021 this is a bit of a tall ask due to shortages being everywhere.

I picked up [one of these](https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/magnus-one-ecm73070c-barebone) recently for our living room – it's an awesome little powerhouse (that makes a lot of noise.) Noise seems to be unimportant to some people and the most important thing to others. Make sure you do your research here on how much noise a PC will make if that matters to you, and probably avoid really small machines unless you are willing to get your hands dirty to bring down the volume.

The main thing to remember with PCs: smaller = more money, faster = more money, high end = mostly for bragging rights. Use a tool like [logical increments](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) to find the right price/performance ratio for you.

Other desktop resources: [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) | [SFF Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) if you are looking to build a smaller machine.

### Monitor

[LG UltraFine 5K](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D24BQBQ/) – LG

~850-1,299 (Price varies by sales + New vs Refurbished) – [Price History](https://camelcamelcamel.com/LG-UltraFine-Monitor-MacBook-Renewed/product/B07D24BQBQ)

Not sure what the poor reviews are about here – I bought mine out of pocket (refurbished), I've been driving this monitor for 3 years now, and it's been solid. If you are using a Mac, use your laptop open with a monitor, and on-screen color matters, then this is the best option.

Options open up a bit more if you are willing to have non-OSX native color (this isn't overly noticeable as long as you don't use your laptop open, or are using a desktop-like a Mac Mini.)

[BenQ EW3270U](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HWBGH5/) (32"", 4K) – BenQ

Matte display, super large. I've daily driven these for a few years now and own two of them. IMO two of these are too big for a desk. If you want something pretty solid and are ok with slightly muted colors, these are a pretty good place to start. You probably want to arm mount these. (Make sure you are ok with how big they are.)

#### Even Bigger?

Once you get over the 32"" range, you have two general directions you can go:

The first: Moving to an Ultrawide.

These are essentially 1.5-2 monitors side by side in a single monitor. They are great for working on multiple things at once, multiple code windows open at once, or playing games in a wide aspect ratio.

The second: Moving up to a TV.

In the past, TVs had pretty atrocious input lag and often couldn't match resolutions with higher-end monitors since they are meant to be viewed from a distance. More recently, in gaming mode good TVs tend to have great response times and the resolution to match.

If you go this route, I'd consider mounting the TV on the wall behind your desk or having a very deep desk. TVs are HOT and very bright. Using a TV for a long time sitting a short distance from your face will likely give you some serious eye strain.

Regardless of which route you go, I'd recommend using some sort of window management software ([OSX](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-mac-window-management-tools/) | [Windows](https://www.slant.co/topics/1249/~best-window-managers-for-windows)) at screen sizes this large. Programs don't tend to utilize this amount of space very well, so being able to set up quadrants is really helpful.

I use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) on OSX generally.

### Smaller monitor for VC

I don't have a specific recommendation here, as most of these are from generic brands, but having a small (13~15"") portable monitor for second screen things like music, as well as a dedicated VC, is pretty handy. Ideally, one with VESA compatible mounting holes is ideal (like [this](https://www.banggood.com/PORPOISE-HT-1330XT-13_3-Inch-1080P-Type-C-Portable-Computer-Monitor-Gaming-Display-Screen-for-Smartphone-Tablet-Laptop-Game-Consoles-p-1666109.html?p=1D22009628395201703K&custlinkid=1507010&cur_warehouse=CN) one), so you can put it on a monitor arm or VESA stand. Your webcam/mic/etc can also sit on top of this to get a better angle.

Something like a [Portal](https://portal.facebook.com/products/) can also work here if you want a flexible, dedicated calling device. Downside: Not mountable. (Disclaimer: I've worked for Facebook, though not on Portal.)

### Monitor Stands

[Wood Desk Shelf](https://grovemade.com/product/wood-desk-shelf/?initial=342) – [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/)

[Wood Laptop Riser](https://grovemade.com/product/wood-laptop-riser/?initial=622) – [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/)

I'll bundle these together, but overall, Grovemade has excellent desktop accessories, including stands. The desk shelf will comfortably fit 2 large-ish monitors (~27in), and you can slide your keyboard or laptop underneath.

The laptop riser adds quite a bit of height, so you would want this to sit beside a monitor and a keyboard/mouse–not use it full time.

The quality of Grovemade products overall are top tier, and I know a lot of people that have these. You probably won't regret investing in these.

These are what I use on my desk today.

If you end up with both, one cool thing is the laptop stand is shaped perfectly that it can sit partially under the shelf, meaning you can line up your laptop screen with your monitor to the side.

### Arms & Risers

More coming on these soon!

### Keyboard

[Das Professional 4 Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/) – [daskeyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/)

Price: \$169

This keyboard checks all the boxes for me – Not visually loud, has quiet options for mechanical keys, a physical knob for volume, media controls... You get the picture. The one thing that would make this keyboard perfect for me is a mute mic button, but I know that is asking a lot. I use the Cherry MX brown version, but if you want something louder/more clicky you can go with Blues.

This keyboard also has a [Windows version](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/), and a [blank key version](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/).

[Generic Brand Mechanical](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E8KO2B0/)

Price: ~\$30-50

A super budget option – I was pretty impressed with this keyboard, Great form factor. Keys are mushy, so if that bugs you, I would avoid this one. I actually like the feel of these keys over many higher-end mechanical keyboards. I'd expect a 1-2 year lifespan out of something like this and no support if something goes wrong.

[Logitech MX KEYS](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mac-wireless-keyboard.920-009552.html?crid=27)

Price: ~\$99

I haven't used these, but Logitech is doing some great things recently with their keyboards & mice. The MX series looks quite promising overall, and I think a single small universal USB for all devices will be quite appealing for many people.

I'd recommend researching these if you just want something that works and will last quite a while.

### Mouse

Mice are highly based on preference, like keyboards, so I'll just share what I have used.

[Razer Death Adder](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/Razer-DeathAdder-V2/RZ01-03210100-R3U1) – Razer

Price: ~$50-$130 (Depends on wireless, buttons, etc.)

I'm sure I'll lose some people over this, but the Death Adder is a solid daily driver – Some people rag on Razer, but I've been using one model or another of the death adder since 2008, and they have always served me well. I'd expect to replace these every 2-3 years (the build is solid, but they often end up double-clicking randomly later in their life, similar to a common issue with Logitech mice.)

[Logitech MX Anywhere 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3-mac.910-005899.html)

As mentioned above, I haven't used this, but the new Logitech line looks quite promising. I'll probably check these out next.

Edit: I did try the MX mice line. The new scroll wheel is love-it-or-hate-it for sure. (I really hated it.) Try this in a store before you buy one!

##### Specialized

SpaceMouse Pro 3D – 3DConnexion

This mouse is for 3D work primarily – if you do a lot of 3D modeling and can get used to the idea of physically navigating 3D space, this will be a HUGE time-saver for you. I never could get into the right mental model to navigate like this, but I was very impressed with the device itself.

Macro Pads (Example: [Razer Tartarus](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Tartarus-Progammable-Detachable-Mecha-Membrane/dp/B07754PYFK/))

There is a huge variety of these, but if your workflow would benefit from a place to map macros, these could be useful. I haven't used this specific one, but in my experience, Razer's software for mapping macros is pretty straightforward.

### Mousepads & Desk Covers

I haven't found my perfect mouse pad yet, but I tend to prefer large, desk cover style ones that the keyboard also sits on. This avoids the awkwardness and physical wear of dragging your arm over the edge of the mouse pad occasionally and also looks better. I've bought a few of these from Amazon in the past few years, but nothing has really stood out.

I'll probably try one of these next:

[Matte Desk Pad](https://grovemade.com/product/matte-desk-pad/?initial=534) – Grovemade

I haven't owned this particular desk pad, but I feel comfortable enough with Grovemade's other products to recommend this one blind. I'd personally avoid the wool ones, I have one of those and I tend to find it a bit scratchy on the skin while mousing around but YMMV.

[Orbitkey Desk Mat](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/orbitkey-desk-mat/products/orbitkey-desk-mat?variant=32750570471520) – Orbitkey

Price: \$65

I haven't owned this one either, but it looks pretty solid, and the cable holder is a big plus to me.

### Audio

[Airpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/select-airpods)/[Airpods Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro) – Apple

Price: $149/$249

I've tried a ton of headphones, and honestly, for meetings and passive listening, nothing really beats the Airpods. Obviously, sound quality isn't the priority here, but the device switching convenience and auto-pause when removing a single side is great. I prefer the shape of the regular Airpods over the pros, and I actually prefer that they don't noise cancel. If you need noise canceling to work, go with the Pros.

I don't really use the wireless charging case, but it probably isn't needed if you are on a budget.

The Max are ok as well... IMO, The Sony XM series are better overhead earphones, and the one below this is way more affordable.

[AT ATH-M50X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/) – Audio-Technica

Price: ~\$120

The classic. You probably know at least one person with pair of headphones or have seen someone on TV wearing them, and for a good reason. These are great, solid, unoffensive headphones. ""Neutral"" describes their sound well. If you need something reasonably priced and high quality, there is a good place to start. There are tons of detailed reviews on the amazon page, so I won't write much more here. (Note: Some people in the reviews recommend trying after-market ear cups on these. I haven't done this on either pair of these that I have, but it could be good to look into.)

There is apparently a Bluetooth version of these available now – I can't speak to them but they might be worth trying out.

[WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) – Sony

Price: \$349

These are the ones I own – I'm not sure why the XM4s are both cheaper (~\$250) and have worse reviews, but these are pretty good. (Gross note: These ear cups tend to gather sweat a decent amount when worn for a few hours.)

While I bought these for working at my desk, the real place they shine is on long flights. With the noise canceling on you, basically forget anyone else is on the plane with you. It more or less completely removes cabin noise.

Overall, if you are just using these as desk headphones, I'd go either cheaper and wired, or with the Airpod Pros.

### Headphone Stands

Overall, this is one area I haven't explored too much. I'll come back and add to this as I do more research and choose something.

[Uppr Zero headphone stand](https://gouppercase.com/products/zero).

I don't own this one, but this is a pretty unique & beautiful headphone stand with an all-aluminum build.

### Video

##### Lower End

[Logitech C922 Pro](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001087.html?crid=34) – [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/webcams)

~\$100

This is a pretty unoffensive option for a starter webcam. For most cases, this will give you an upgrade to your video and audio quality without breaking the bank.

Also promising:

[Software](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483) + A Phone

This is becoming a more popular option, and the results are pretty good. You can get high-quality video out of your phone that you might already have. It can be a bit of a hassle to set up and take down your phone daily, but it is an option.

[Moment](https://www.shopmoment.com/) has also been kicking off a promising [Magsafe line](https://www.shopmoment.com/magsafe) for mounting. This might be helpful with this type of approach.

##### Higher End

DSLR/Mirrorless + Capture Card

Price: _~\$300 all the way to tens of thousands_

What most people you see with ""amazing"" looking video quality/youtube videos are using. There are _way_ to many options to get into here. I'm in the Sony ecosystem, so I'd recommend something like the a5100, a6300~ or Alpha 7C (these range from ~300-1.7k)

I'll link to [a post like this](https://www.epiphan.com/blog/best-cameras-for-live-streaming/) and let you dive in further.

[Pi HD Cam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) – [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

This is a pretty cool + hacker-friendly option. The lenses it uses are inexpensive CCTV lenses as well. I'm hoping to write up a post on creating a VC setup using the Raspberry Pi at some point, so I'll revisit this then!

### Accessories

[CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) – [CalDigit](https://www.caldigit.com/)

(~\$230+)

If you buy a single high-end accessory for your desk, this is the one I would recommend.

Flawless connectivity across multiple monitors, high-quality USB, card reader and full power even for 16"" 100W Macbook Pros. I've used my for the past 4 years and I've never had a single issue with it, and know at least 15 people who all have had a similar experience. This is the baseline for high-quality tech.

(I've read some reports of people having issues with these and their Macbook Pros. I was surprised to hear this, as I know many, many people with these that have never had any issues, but once again YMMV.)

Caldigit has a few other options these days for docks – you can see if a different one meets your needs better, but I do recommend something with it's own power source, not something that pulls power from the laptop.

Overall, if the price doesn't put it completely out of your budget, this is a really solid building block for your desk setup.

[Under desk volume knob and macro keyboard](https://www.pikatea.com/collections/products/products/pikatea-macropad-gb2).

I haven't had a chance to try this yet, but I've been looking to buy something like this for years. The keys act as a bindable macro keyboard, and the knob works by default for volume and mute/unmute. Looking forward to picking one of these up to see if I can turn it into a hardware remote for Video Conferencing.

[Yeelight – LED Light Bar Pro](https://en.yeelight.com/product/1512.html).

This sits on top of your monitor and illuminates the whole desk surface evenly without adding glare to the monitor.

This one is pretty good; my only complaints are 1) it is pretty wobbly when you go to press the buttons and 2) the buttons are capacitive. I'd eventually like to replace this with something more sturdy with physical buttons.

It is pretty amazing how much it illuminates on the desk without washing out the screen. One thing of note, it fights for physical real estate with your webcam. Mine is awkwardly stacked on top, but I'd love a better solution.

### Chair

More coming on these soon!

I'm using an Aeron right now, but I'm not convinced this is as good as it gets, and likely a really good chair setup can be had for far less than what and Aeron costs.

Will return as I research and learn more.

### Wifi/Networking

#### Ethernet

If you don't have a dock with Ethernet, at least some sort of small USB-C to Ethernet dongle is a must-have ([Example cheap on](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VPMPT6M/)e, I have this one and it works fine.)

#### Wifi

This deserves it's own post, probably, but if you want something you plug in and it works, I'd look into something like [Nest Wifi](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_wifi?hl=en-US) or [Erro](https://eero.com/shop).

These are easy to use and troubleshoot and are systems you can build on as you need more.

If you want to start by buying into the upper end of systems, you can build you can start with something like [this](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/unifi-dream-machine) and expand as you go.

A Ubiquiti setup is going to be on the upper end of where you can go without going full enterprise tier, and the setup isn't overly complicated.

Their access points start at a [super reasonable price](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-ap-6-lite) and you can keep expanding this system almost infinitely. You can also plug-in cameras, door access systems and more in, similar to Nest, but it all runs local on your network rather than sending data to a third party.

Edit: After using a Ubiquiti setup for the past ~1 year, I'd say MOST people are going to do better with a Google Wifi (or comparable) mesh wifi setup and a big network switch. Even if you want to run cameras, etc, you are probably better off using Homebridge and various cameras.

### Extras

I haven't tried any of the below, but I'll here are some of the things I'm interested in checking out next.

[Grommet USB Hub](https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Desk-USB-HUB/dp/B0863KCTFZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=orico%2Bdesk%2Bgrommet&qid=1603851450&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=minimalistik-20&linkId=5c5001a8363b68a8e6217aed8ba31bc6&language=en_US&th=1) – Generic

This is a pretty cool idea – I already use grommet holes to run cables from the top of my desk to the bottom; adding a hub here for things like headphones and quick USB access is pretty handy.

#### Accent Lighting

[Corsair iCUE LT100](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Ambient-Lighting/iCUE-LT100-Smart-Lighting-Towers-Starter-Kit/p/CD-9010002-NA) – Corsair

These seem like a nice way to add lighting to your desk (if you are into that kind of thing) without sticking light strips everywhere.

Custom Cables

A store like [this](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CustomCableCo) can hook you up with some really amazing custom cables that can help finish the look of your desk. These are one of the first things people will notice!

## General Wrap Up Thoughts

### Buying from Amazon

If you have a shopping history with them, buy through Amazon where possible. Their customer support generally will fix problems no questions asked, and often on lower priced items not even have you send them back. Always look for the Prime tag, avoid buying from Amazon Marketplace accounts or items tagged ""Fulfilled by Amazon.""

Expect buying through Amazon, you will eventually get a returned item.

### Credit Card Perks

This really depends on what you have access to, but a high-end credit card like a [Sapphire Reserve](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/sapphire/reserve) will not only protect you against fraud, but also protect you against accidental damage. When we bought our [LG GX 65](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65gxpua-oled-4k-tv) I cracked it when wall mounting it. Chase replaced the TV for us under their accidental damage policy (Caps out at ~10k.) Cards like Chase Sapphire Preferred can offer up to ~1k in accidental damage as well.

(Aside: Save yourself some pain, never try to wall mount a large OLED yourself – [Replacing the display is more expensive than buying a new tv.](https://homeguide.com/costs/tv-repair-cost))
