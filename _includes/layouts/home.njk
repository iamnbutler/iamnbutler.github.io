    <h1>Hey, I'm Nate ‚úåüèΩ</h1>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm a designer & maker that has been working in the product design
      industry for the past 10 years. I believe enabling people to share
      themselves, their ideas, and their creativity, responsibly &
      regardless of platform. I don't think our major platforms are
      doing this well and we have a way to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes me passionate about the democratizaion of tools and
      knowledge ‚Äî I‚Äôd rather teach people the tools to do something
      themselves than create something that does it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I post about all types of things here. You will find a mix of
      work, top of mind, reflections, random posts & process. Enjoy!
