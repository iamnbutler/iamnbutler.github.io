Hey ðŸ‘‹
======

I'm Nate!

Why is the site kinda jank?
---------------------------

Welcome to my very 'build-in-the-open' personal site. **Expect everything not to work!**

I'm a bit addicted to things being perfect before sharing. I've actually never shipped a personal site because of this.

This is my attempt to just throw everything out there, don't worry about things being unfinished, and just build everything a bit at a time.

Let's build a website
---------------------

I've been dreaming of a simple md-driven site that pulls from a data repository for a long time. I've become a bit "files-on-disk" believer over the past little while, in a world that is increasingly storing everything in the cloud.

Structurally, my biggest personal inspiration for a website has been the Mac OS notes app for a few years now. I love the simple mental model of `folder â†’ note â†’ content`,So I'm giving it a shot to see where I get.

So far I'm *part* of the way there, I've got the `.md` part going... Once the basic site is done I'll pivot to figure out how to pull things directly from my personal [data](https://github.com/iamnbutler/data) repo.

Here is a rough [~mood board~](https://www.figma.com/file/VNpgDenh0jr5gin1E5YoJt/v-14-moodboard?node-id=0%3A1) of some themes I have in my head. I don't know how much will influence the site in the end... I'm starting from structure and content first before style, as I tend to get lost in the visuals and never return to finish the rest ðŸ˜…

Anyways...
