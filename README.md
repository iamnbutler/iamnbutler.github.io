# web-starter

The aim for this starter isn't to be comprehensive, but to be a head start for fully custom projects.

## Structure

There are `required` and `optional` components. 

Required components should be only the things that most every project uses.

Optional components include helpful head starts on things like styled code blocks, table of contents components, starter prose styles, etc.
