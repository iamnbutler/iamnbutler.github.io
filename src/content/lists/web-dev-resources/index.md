## Preface

I'm mostly a hobby developer u2013 I've learned mostly by taping together bits of code found all over the internet for years now. This space is mostly for remembering the cool and useful shit I run across, but hopefully you can find something useful in here!

## Tools

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) u2013 More or less the god of code editors at this point. I was resistant to moving to something so "heavy", only to find once I tried it it is incredibly fast on top of being packed with useful stuff.
- [Codekit](https://codekitapp.com/) u2013 All sorts of fun things out of the box. Compass, local servers, sass compilation & more. I use VSCode more these days to cover these needs, but I relied on Codekit for years.
- [RunJS](https://runjs.app/) - JavaScript playground for your desktop
