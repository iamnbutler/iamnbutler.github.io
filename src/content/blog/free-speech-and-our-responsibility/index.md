Context: When this was written I was working at Facebook (2020).

## Doing nothing isn't Being Bold.

Where is the line between responsibility and censorship?

Like everything, this probably isn't a solid line but actually more of a gradation.

Working at FB this is something I think about constantly, especially since the outcome of the 2016 election. Joining Facebook as a starry-eyed new grad, I came in wanting to make the world a better place. My goal at FB was always to bring a little bit of extra fun and joy to the world.

Little did I know what I was getting myself in to...

## Thoughts on Free Speech

I don't have an answer to what the right solution is here – But my stance leans towards this:

Ultimately Facebook is a private platform, and I think we should do what we can proactively to curb hate speech, threats of violence, and the spread of misinformation.

I will always believe that we should foster conversation that moves the world toward being a better place. It's not for us to decide what is right and wrong, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have values.

I realize it isn't this simple, however. I believe by treating companies like FB, Twitter the same as speech we inadvertently create a false equivalence between the two.

A platform should set its own rules – Where this often becomes a problem is that those rules should be clearly defined and upheld. I'm also not sure we know as a people how to moderate content on the scale of billions (especially without leaning into AI, which has it's own bias issues as well.)

I think this will grow into one of the larger challenges we face as platforms continue to scale.

I think we have a long, long way to go in this space, and the edges of speech on social media will continue to be pushed. As I said above, I don't have a solution here but I think we have to continue to try rather than absolve any say in what is on our platforms.

## Our Responsibility

That being said, people, and especially designers in my opinion, have a responsibility to evaluate the impact of their work on the world and own that. The way things are built at Facebook really doesn't encourage designers to do this, as often they have been working on another project for many months, potentially even at another team at the company.

Often by the time problems arise, the team that built that product no longer exists, or all the people that have worked on it have moved on. I'm not really sure how we improve here in a space that encourages quick wins over long range support and experiential improvement, but I think we have a responsibility to try.

A start would be to review the failures of the product as growth opportunities the same way we evaluate potential growth from a metrics perspective.

As I've said many times here, I don't know the solution here. I hope as designers we can start with scaling our own impact beyond just shipping products to evaluating their long term impacts on the people that use them.
