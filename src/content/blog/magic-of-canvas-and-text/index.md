As I dive into building my own canvas editor I'm starting to wonder about the folks and tech that has come before. Here is a collection of things I've found so far (with hopefully more to come!)

## Canvas

[**Figma**](https://www.madebyevan.com/figma/) - [Evan Wallace](https://www.madebyevan.com/)

A collection of writings on technical work on Figma.

[**Figma**](https://rsms.me/work/figma/) - [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/)

An overall overview of the Figma by Rasmus, including design, engineering, and culture.

[**Inside Sketch: A deep dive into our Canvas tech**](https://www.sketch.com/blog/canvas-tech/) - Pieter Omvlee

[**Figma 1**](https://andrewkchan.dev/posts/figma.html) & [**Figma 2**](https://andrewkchan.dev/posts/figma2.html) - Andrew Chan

### Scene Graph

[**Wikipedia: Scene Graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph)

Some advantages of the scene graph:

- single parent, multiple children
- propagate operations downwards to children
- culling of non-visible elements
- streamlined hit testing and selection

## Text

[**Text Rendering Hates You**](https://faultlore.com/blah/text-hates-you/) - [faultlore](https://faultlore.com/)

A bible on text rendering.
