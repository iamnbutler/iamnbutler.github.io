In 2016 we released the iOS 11 GUI on facebook.design as a continuation of the GUI resources started by [Teehan & Lax](https://teehanlax.com/). I worked on the Photoshop resources, and also designed a series of abstract 3D backgrounds that were used in the GUI promo materials.

We also distributed these separately as a wallpaper pack.
