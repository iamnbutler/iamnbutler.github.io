This post is a work in progress!

I've been building up a shop in my basement over the last few years, mostly for tinkering with woodworking projects. Over the last few months I've started to work towards building more furniture. I've also started learning what creators actually know what they are talking about and what is just thinly veiled marketing...

It's got me thinking, what do I actually need? What would I actually buy if I were starting a wood shop from scratch today?

I have a whole slew of random tools, power tools, some cheap tools, some espensive tools–you get the drift. I've bought the same tool many times over thinking "This slightly more expensive one will totally make the difference, right?"

In reality, I think there are a few core, surprising non-obvious tools you need to get started, and they might not be what you think. Or at least, they weren't what I thought.

## Buy once, cry once

When starting out, inevitably much of your search history will be "{insert tool} reddit". You will see this mentioned in almost every thread – "Buy once, cry once."

It basically means, invest in the best tool you can afford, because you will end up buying it again if you don't. This is especially true for tools that are used often, or tools that are used for precision work.

This means _generally_ avoiding budget tools, from brands like Ryobi, Ridgid, or Harbor Freight (though there are exceptions). It also means understanding which "prosumer" tools from the big brands like DeWalt, Milwaukee, or Makita are actually quality tools.

There are occasions where there is simply a "best tool" for a given job, and sometimes it isn't the most expensive. For example, the [Bosch ROS20V](https://www.boschtools.com/ca/en/products/ros20vsc-0601387514) is widely considered the best 5" random orbital sander for most people, and it is under $100.

Part of this is understanding what tools you actually will use beyond the lifecycle of a cheap tool like a Ryobi. If you're just going to use a tool once, then maybe a cheap tool is fine. But if you're going to use it a lot, then you should invest in a quality tool. You likely don't need the $400 Makita power inflator, for example, and the $20 Ryobi one will be fine.

There is an alternative, potentially equally valid philosophy, which is to buy the cheapest tool you can find, and then replace it with a quality tool if you use it enough to warrant it. This can be a good philosophy for most things, with exceptions.

For example, a cheap router table with a bed that isn't flat is going to be worse than just investing in some accessories for your palm router.

But a cheap set of chisels might be fine uif you learn how to sharpen them properly.

## What you need to get started, in order

I'm going to skip over some really obvious stuff, like a way to turn a philips head screw, or something to hit things with.

**Table Stakes**

- Screwdrivers – [A set like this](https://products.wera.de/en/ratchets_and_accessories_zyklop_mini_zyklop_mini_1_tool-check_plus.html) will go a long way to getting you started.
- Hammer – Just a regular hammer, and one rubber mallet.
- Glue – Titebond III is a great glue, and it has a longer set time than I or II, which is great for beginners.
- Painters Tape – You can use this to mask off areas you don't want to get glue on, or to hold things together while the glue dries. It's also great for ensuring plywood edges don't blow out when cutting.
- Fasteners – A variety of screws – I highly suggest getting some star drive screws, they are much easier to drive and don't strip as easily.

Here's what I think you need to get started, or at least what I would buy day one if I were starting over:

### 1. A Work Surface (ideally with a Vice)

[Example – SJÖBERGS Smart Workstation Pro](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/sjobergs-smart-workstation-pro)

You don't need to spend $400, but something with a built in vice (no not [one of these](https://www.diesella.com/products/machine-vices/drilling-machine-vices/bench-vise-in-cast-iron-100-mm)) will go a really long way to getting you started.

As [Paul Sellers](https://www.youtube.com/@Paul.Sellers) often says, "The vice is like your third hand..." It will make a big difference in almost every project.

You can also build something yourself like this:

[3x3 Custom's PORTABLE WORKBENCH](https://www.3x3custom.com/tutorials/portable-workbench)

A few recs: [Veritas Work Surface](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/work-surfaces/73498-veritas-worksurface) | [Dewalt Express Folding Work Bench](https://www.dewalt.ca/product/dwst11556/express-folding-workbench)

### 2. Drills & Drivers

Since early on you will likely be putting together a lot of shop furniture and other quick projects, a good drill & driver combo will go along way.

If I was starting again today I'd get this set: [M12 FUEL 2-Tool Combo Kit](https://www.milwaukeetool.ca/Products/3497-22). The angled grip on the driver really makes a difference in tight spaces, and in general comfort.

Otherwise I'd suggest a quality brushless drill or combo. Generally a brushless drill should be enough to get you through most things for the first many projects. The one from DeWalt and Makita are both quite good.

Budget in getting a drill guide like the excellent and inexpensive [Milescraft Drillmate](https://milescraft.com/product/drillmate/). A great drill won't help that much if you can't make straight holes in many cases – And you will likely continue to use it even after you get a drill press for those awkward to reach places, or drilling after assembly.

### 3. Marking & Measuring

Getting a good set of marking and measuring tools is likely one of the most impactful things you can buy early. You will need a ruler and tape measure at least. Doing some research and getting a ruler that is also a straight edge can save you some money in the long run.

Since I mostly work on smaller things, I like having a tape measure that's only about 6 feet since it's lighter, and I can buy a few of them for the same cost and keep them all over the shop.

For rough marking, getting some pencils and a sharpener that you keep in the shop all the time can be good but in reality getting a few sharp, utility knives with replaceable blades and a caddy for swapping out blades and throwing out old ones will be your best bet.

Once you learn how to mark measurements with a knife and a square, you'll likely not go back to using pencils very often except for extremely rough work.

You will need a square. Most people will suggest the stare at 12 inch combo Square as the top-of-the-line option. The thing they won't mention is that it's expensive and heavy and if you drop it it's no better than any other square I'd suggest doing some research and buying a square or machinist square that you know is accurate, then buying some chief plastic squares to use every day that you can tune using your accurate Square.

I use my set of machinist squares on almost every single project. Try to find one with a case if that will help you keep them organized and put away like it does for me.

### 4. A Set of Saws

At the very least, you will need two saws one for making larger cuts, and one for finer work, like cutting dovetails or other joinery.

Do a little bit of research on the difference between western and Japanese style saws. you will likely gravitate to one or the other I'll provide some suggestions for each below but investing in a good saw over something from Home Depot will make a huge difference. Sawing by hand doesn't have to be a miserable experience.

### 4.1 Track or Circular Saw

You don't need this right away, but you will likely want one soon. Until you have a track saw you can pay to have your sheet goods cut down at the store, or use a circular saw with a straight edge guide.

If you're going to be working with sheet goods (large sheets of plywood, larger stock, typically 4x8 feet) then you will likely want a track saw or a circular saw with a track.

This is one case where I'd suggest one specific tool: The [Makita Track Saw](https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/SP6000J) is the best track saw on the market at an obtainable price. It's not cheap, but it literally redefines what you can do with sheet goods in a small shop at a reasonable pace.

The Makita track system has 3 sizes of track, a 39", 55", and 118" track. I'd suggest getting the 55" track to start, but if you can afford it adding the 39" track is really nice as using the 55" track on smaller pieces on your bench can be a bit awkward.

The Makita track system is also compatible with Festool tracks, so accessories are interchangeable.

I know you won't listen (I didn't) but if you can afford it, get the battery powered version. The cost jump is significant, but it is the hidden cost of buying into the Makita tool ecosystem. Generally in a small shop, I don't think you _need_ battery tools, but when working with sheet goods you are moving the tool such a large distance over the cut, the likelyhood of getting your chord caught on something is high. After my very first cut I already knew I had made a mistake. By the 5th cut, I caught the chord on the track and bit into it with the blade. This is just one of those buy once cry once situations.

If you have more money than you know what to do with, the Festool track saw is the best track saw on the market. But honestly, I'd save the difference and use that money to save towards a Domino!

I'd also specifically recommend against the the [Kreg Accu-Cut](https://www.kregtool.com/shop/cutting/circular-saw-cutting/accu-cut/KMA2700.html). I've owned one, and anyone I know that has owned one has had the same experience. It's a good idea, but it's not a good tool. It's not accurate or easy to use. You would be better off just learning how to use a straight edge and get some track clamps than buying this.
