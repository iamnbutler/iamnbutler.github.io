## Designing an audiobook player for people with their own files

Earlier this year I was about a year into my Audiobook crazy, consuming a couple of books a week at least. I went down a huge Sci-fi rabbit hole!

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of options though if you don't want to either use Libby or stick with Audible.

I started reviving JUICE as an audiobook player where people could bring their own files. The audiobook landscape is pretty scattered, and not everyone wants to be tied to Audible and Amazon. Here you could connect a google drive, dropbox, etc and build your library.

I wanted to focus to be more around series, building out a robust model for handling series with complex orders and multiple reading orders, etc.

This is how far I got:
