I absolutely love Google's Music streaming service, but their desktop notifications are severely lacking, and the extensions that I've seen have not been much better. This is a simple concept of what a notification could look like.

Font is Segoe UI. Shuffle icon is from the Gliphish icon pack.

Also debut shot! Hello Dribbble :) Tell me what you think!
