Inevitably when building an app you have various state and data that you want accessible from anywhere in an app.\n\nWhen using gpui, thanks to Rust's powerful trait system, you can use an extension to do thisâ€“and it is pretty handy.\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nHow it works\n\nHere's the basic idea:\nDefine a trait with the methods you want to add to App\nImplement that trait for the App type\nUse your methods wherever you have a reference to App\n\nMinimally:\n\nWith this trait defined, you can use it wherever you have an App reference:\n\nExample: Adding Convenient, Global Theme Access\n\nLet's walk adding an example where you can access the theme anywhere from where you have an App reference.\n\nLet's start by defining a basic theme:\n\nNow we need to make it accessible globally:\n\nTo make something accessible globally in gpui we need to create a global wrapper:\n\nThis wrapper lets us store our theme in App's global state and access it easily with dereferencing.\n\nThen we can define a trait that we will use to extend App:\n\nThis is a simple one, but you could define anything here... A whole theme registry, logic for swapping themes, etc.\n\nThen we implement our extension on App:\n\nNow we can use our extension in our UI:\n\nHere is everything together (or grab the example)\n\nEnjoy!

These always seem to be a bit of a pain because the vendor requirements are always changing. Evil Martians have a really great writeup that covers a lot of this here: How to Favicon in 2024: Six files that fit most needs\n.\n\nWe'll mostly follow that, with a few Astro-isms tossed in.\n\nTo start, we'll need to create an asset for our favicon. I'd actually recommend calling this something other than favicon to prevent the browser from loading it in a way you don't expect, due to it looking for things named favicon.\n\nIn the end, these are the assets I ended up with:\n\nThe SVG Favicon\n\nicon.svg does double duty as both the light and dark mode icon.\n\nWe use a media query to change the fill color of the icon based on the user's preferred color scheme. This means that even if a user's browser uses a dark color tab bar, the favicon will still look good.\n\nThis approach feels a bit more elegant than swapping out the icon with JavaScript, or having multiple icons in the markup.\n\nThe Dev-Mode Favicon\n\nA cool little trick I picked up from the Evil Martians article is to use a different icon in development environments. The approach they used was a little different, involving a custom webpack plugin, but we can do something far easier in Astro.\n\nHere is my current head.astro file:\n\nAstro exposes these handy base environment variables that we can use to conditionally load different assets based on the environment.\n\nUsing them we can conditionally load the icon-dev.svg in development environments, and the regular icon.svg in production to make it super clear from the tab bar which environment we're in.\n\nI love this so much as I constantly get mixed up with a prod tab open, and spend time debugging only to realize I'm in the wrong environment... maybe just me ðŸ˜…\n\nThe Web App Manifest\n\nThe web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when 'installed' on the user's mobile device or desktop.\n\nMine is pretty simple:\n\nThis will ensure places that use it will get the higher definition icons, and the browser will know what to do when the user tries to add the site to their home screen.\n\nAnd that is it!\n\nLet me know if I missed anything...\n\nThere are a million different sizes and shapes for favicons, but I feel like this is a resonable amount of coverage for something simple like a personal site or blog."

A reasonably unstructured collection of tips and tricks for building UI in gpui.\n\nThis post will give a bit more flavor as we go to the examples in the gpui-examples repo.\n\nApplication & Context\n\nRemove the default titlebar\n\nExample â€“ Hide titlebar\n\nThis one is pretty straight forward. but immediately useful.\n\nIf you are building a reasonably custom looking UI, hiding the titlebar is one of the first things you will be looking to do.\n\nSince this one is so short, I'll just share the whole main fn:\n\n~~~rs\nfn main() {\n    let windowoptions = WindowOptions {\n        titlebar: None,\n        ..Default::default()\n    };\n\n    Application::new().run(|cx: &mut App| {\n        cx.openwindow(windowoptions, |, cx| {\n            // your app\n        })\n        .unwrap();\n\n        cx.activate(true);\n    });\n}\n~~~\n\nBasically, just pass None to titlebar in WindowOptions. This will give you an app with no titlebar at all.\n\nExtending cx\n\nExample â€“ Context Extension\n\nAdd globally accessible data and methods with a central way to access them by extending App.\n\nI have a full post on this one, but here is a quick example:\n\n~~~rs\n// Define a basic theme struct\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct Theme {\n    fg: Hsla,\n    bg: Hsla,\n    accent: Hsla,\n}\n\nimpl Default for Theme {\n    fn default() -> Self {\n        Theme {\n            fg: hsla(220.0 / 360.0, 9.0 / 100.0, 72.0 / 100.0, 1.0),\n            bg: hsla(220.0 / 360.0, 14.0 / 100.0, 18.0 / 100.0, 1.0),\n            accent: hsla(207.0 / 360.0, 82.0 / 100.0, 66.0 / 100.0, 1.0),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Make it accessible globally\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct GlobalTheme(pub Arc<Theme>);\n\nimpl Deref for GlobalTheme {\n    type Target = Arc<Theme>;\n    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target { &self.0 }\n}\n\nimpl Global for GlobalTheme {}\n\n// Define the extension trait\npub trait ActiveTheme {\n    fn theme(&self) -> &Arc<Theme>;\n}\n\n// Implement the extension for App\nimpl ActiveTheme for App {\n    fn theme(&self) -> &Arc<Theme> {\n        &self.global::<GlobalTheme>().0\n    }\n}\n\n// Set your global theme\nfn main() {\n    Application::new().run(|cx: &mut App| {\n        // Initialize the global theme\n        cx.setglobal(GlobalTheme(Arc::new(Theme::default())));\n\n        cx.openwindow(windowoptions, |window, cx| {\n            // Now you can access the theme anywhere\n            cx.newview(|cx| MyView::new(cx))\n        }).unwrap();\n    });\n}\n\n// Then use your context extension anywhere\nimpl Render for MyView {\n    fn render(&mut self, : &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {\n        div()\n            .textcolor(cx.theme().fg)\n            .bg(cx.theme().bg)\n            // ... other properties\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nUI Components\n\nConditional Rendering\n\nWhen building UI, one of the most common tasks is conditional rendering.\n\nYou can do this with if/match obviously:\n\n~~~rs\n#[derive(RenderOnce)]\npub struct Checkbox {\n    pub checked: bool,\n}\n\nimpl RenderOnce for Checkbox {\n    fn render(self, : &mut Window, cx: &mut App) -> impl IntoElement {\n        div()\n            .child(\n                if self.checked {\n                    // might return some svg\n                    Icon::check().intoanyelement()\n                } else {\n                    // else return an empty element\n                    div().intoanyelement()\n                }\n            )\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nbut there are a number of other useful conditional rendering patterns as well:\n.when\n.whensome\n.whennone\n.children combined with methods returning an Option<AnyElement>\n\nmore coming soon"

I'm trying out Astro, and it feels oddly nostalgic for some reason â€“ like I'm building a site in the early 2000s. It's a bit of a throwback, but in a good way.\n\nI'm keeping things really simple for now. A single stylesheet, markdown for content, and a few components.\n\nSo far Astro's Content Collections have made getting content into the site really easy. It is nice that it uses Zod right out of the box for validation as if I'm working with TypeScript it feels wrong to have untyped data like markdown frontmatter usually is.\n\nHonestly, it's been a bit of a struggle not using Tailwind for the first time in quite a whileâ€“but it's been interesting getting back into the swing of writing CSS again.\n\nRather than where I usually get held up when building a new site (trying to backport content, update posts I never finished, try to get things perfect...)

    "body": "A two part project: one part illustration, one part narrative. It was born out of a desire to make without a problem, to make for the sake of making. This is a project about discovery, identifying weakness, and finding strength. A two part project: one part illustration, one part narrative. It was born out of a desire to make without a problem, to make for the sake of making.\n\nLearning to Make\n\nThe illustrations began by exploring the ideas of lost worlds and alternate realities but as the project continued it began to gradually in change form.\n\nThe idea of making without a goal or problem in mind was both terrifying and liberating. Designers are used to the idea of making from a brief or a set of instructions, or finding a solution to a problem. Here I sought to explore the scope of possibilities outside the prototypical design process. The project is a rejection all that is design: creating using a problem and solution formula. It is a dive into the concept of design as making, creating to discover about the world and one's self.\n\nPerhaps saying that the project doesn't deal with a problem is misleading. It would be more correct to say that the problem is the process in which making powers discoveries through research. It is easy to become complacent when designing from project briefs, and it is easy to lose some of the imagination and pure creation that one starts out with in design when following this process. Exploring showed how to research and design bymaking--creating work that by itself was not solving a problem, but when put together in series showed development and expansion of of voice.\n\nVisual Research\n\nSketching came first in the form of simple geometric illustrations. There was an idea of geometric shapes and forms right from the beginning. The direction pursued was one of exploring an unknown world, of teleportation and telepresence.\n\nThis idea manifested itself in the work through form, layering and artistic direction. Rather than focus on designing to these ideas, they simply existed as a springboard into a deep process of making.\n\nCreating a Process\n\nI began exploring various 3D softwares. I stumbled upon a delightful voxel design program called MagicaVoxel (a voxel is the 3D equivalent of a 2D pixel.) It was a simple, very lightweight program that allowed quick prototyping of ideas, with rather straightforward rendering tools.\n\nThe process of designing work was a form of visual research for me. By first creating, then observing work out in the world and then reflecting and creating again I could see a shift in the voice of the work I created. This was a strange but exciting feeling to me as I had not worked in this fashion intensely before, discovering new ideas by creating rather than doing formal research.\n\nI quickly desired more depth in my 3D software so I explored Blender and Maya. I spent a large amount of time working on learning the new workflows of these platforms, but noticed that the quality of the work I produced week to week was less. I was spending less time on finding exciting compositions and interactions and more on developing new techniques and learning how to do more complex rendering. While this in itself is not a bad thing, because of the short nature of the project I decided to go back to the simpler software I worked with to continue to develop my ideas.\n\nTo summate the results of my making and research so far I created a series of five posters. The posters address the topics of intention, message, complexity and fluidity. They include narrative that discuss results and act as visual process, exposing a landmark in my research.\n\nOne of the themes that came up during this process of summation and evaluation of work completed was the cyclical nature of the making process. Exploration and research lead to making, which lead to new inspiration, which in turn lead to more exploration and research to find how to make the next desired piece, and so forth. While this is true of many processes it seemed to occur very rapidly while making in this manner.\n\nTaking a Step Back\n\nBeginning from the second half of the project, while making continued as in the first half, I began to explore writing as another way to challenge weakness. Writing is an important aspect of design that is often overlooked and one that I personally struggle with. By diving into writing different aspects of making could be addressed. Language, personal versus impersonal writing, pacing and sentence structure are similar to the tools used in production design, akin to the pen tool, the type tool, rulers, guides and shapes. By seeing writing beyond just words it reveals itself as another form ofcreating--one which can be explored, manipulated, molded and crafted.\n\nI decided to make a mini-site with a collection of four stories reflecting on things I had learned during my time in and out of school over the past four years. By drawing from my own experience I'm able to write about topics that I care about, but attempt to universalize them so that they are applicable to many other designers that may read the stories. The stories included:\n\n1 -- The Impostor Inside\n\nIdentifying impostor syndrome and understanding your value\n\n2 -- Break the Cycle\n\nLiving with depression and dealing with it's effects on your creative process\n\n3 -- Make! Make! Make!\n\nWhy finding a balance between collecting knowledge and making is important\n\n4 -- Kill Your Idols\n\nThere is no such thing as a design superstar, just those with more experience, and those that put the work in\n\nMaking By Reflecting\n\nThe writing began as a mostly self-reflective process, but I learned through the process that simply reading someone else's reflections does not drive a desire for change, or help the reader to feel the impact of the writing.\n\nAs I wrote and rewrote my stories I attempted to lead into less personal rhetoric as the story progressed to help universalize the problem being discussed. The goal was not to tell others how I dealt with impostor syndrome or worked through my depression, but rather to inspire others who may be dealing with or know others dealing with the same situations, and maybe learn some steps to take to help climb out of these situations."

    "title": "Writing with ADHD",
    "url": "/blog/writing-with-adhd",
    "body": "A personal reflection on how ADHD affects my writing process, inspired by Geraint Evans' article on ADHD writing styles. This post is a reflection on Geraint Evans' \"This is how an ADHD\nperson actually writes.\"\nI'd start there first!\n\nI'm a terrible writer.\n\nOr, at least, I've convinced myself of that my whole life. The things that I write flow awkwardly, and I never understand all the rules of writing and the way to make things sound immersive and natural. My writing ends up awkwardly verbose and tends to wander a lot. I tend to mix tenses constantly.\n\nI never understood why I write the way I do, until I discovered at the beginning of the year that I have rather severe inattentive ADHD.\n\n---\n\nComing across this tweet was pretty mind blowing for me. It was like someone speaking to the way I write for the first time in my life. Then seeing tons of replies under it validating the way ADHD people write I realized I wasn't alone in this. Honestly, you should probably just go read Geraint's article \"This is how an ADHD person actually writes.\" instead of reading this, but I'll do my best to share my thoughts on top of it.\n\nIn his article Geraint calls out four main points in his concussion, so I'll use that as a starting point. (And sorry if this structure doesn't make sense... You know. ADHD Â¯\\(ãƒ„)/Â¯)\n\nHere are the four points:\nImpulsivity â€“ \"Impulsivity & rushing through tasks - I need to say this now!\"\nAttention to detail - \"Yeah, probably fine, ill just post it.\"\nBeing socially inappropriate â€“ \"Sorry, why do I have to change how I communicate when you clearly understand what I mean?\"\nFeeling Misunderstood.\n\nWe'll dive into each separately.\n\nImpulsivity\n\nGotta go fast. Having my special flavor of ADHD means a mind constantly full of ideas at all times. You know that expression \"drinking from the fire hose\"? It's like that, but 8+ hours of the day, every day (before completely running out of energy and crashing, but that is a topic for another time.)\n\nA lot of ideas\n\nEven trying to sit down and write this out, it's hard to move to the next because there are 18 different ways I could continue this sentence, and 14 of them probably involve a complete topic change.\n\nEach idea feels like it is so incredibly pressing, and the entire world should hear about this â€“ only to be frustrated after tweeting it out to the world, bugging a coworker or talking to my partner, and finding no interest at all in it.\n\nWriting with ADHD means TONS of edit passes on even a few paragraphs because often I've shoved so many ideas into a small space that it feels overwhelming and disjointed to read. It ends up being hard to follow because I've left out a bunch of the in-between framing context that is in my head that I forget others can't follow.\n\nOverly passionate\n\nOften having this volume of ideas, and an immense, fast burning passion for a topic means things are often oversold, or phrased incorrectly.\n\nI remember once writing an email to a director at my then-work flagging that a product decision was \"unethical\" because I believed strongly we were making the wrong decision. In reality, while it was a bad decision, unethical was both the incorrect framing AND severity. Would both craft and inclusivity suffer from this decision?\n\nYes. However, was this a decision that was any more or less severe from the thousands made at the company every day? No, not really. In the moment though, it seemed like the most important thing in the universe, and my passion was dialed to 11.\n\nLuckily, this person was highly empathetic, and explained to the email chain what I likely meant (and why I was over-reacting) without condescending. It was really eye opening to me, and I always remember that. (Aside: Stick with the people who will call out out in a loving way! These people will help you grow immensely.)\n\nBecause I feel like I've explained absolutely nothing here, that seems like a great time to move on to point two!\n\nAttention to detail\n\nThis one's short description nails it on the head: \"Yeah, probably fine, ill just post it.\"\n\nThis pretty much captures my whole sentiment here, and really conflicts with the last point, Feeling Misunderstood, yet some how coexist.\n\nHow this often manifests is either 1) writing for hours, attempting to get things right or concise or understandable and eventually getting frustrated and hitting post, or 2) blasting some writing out in 30 seconds and pressing send without even reading it back.\n\nI was never able to write papers in school because if I tried to edit a long piece of writing, rather than editing it I would just end up rewriting the whole thing on each edit pass. In the end I defaulted to writing a few hours before the deadline so I wouldn't have time to fret over the contents or writing style. I call this \"Deadline Adrenaline.\" I found I got better grades and responses often with just throwing something out there on the first pass than trying to write in a way others would understand easily (because, of course I couldn't do that. My brain doesn't work that way.)\n\nDeadline Adrenaline\n\nAn aside â€“ deadline adrenaline is something that I've come to lean on as an ADHD person throughout all parts of my life. I'm not sure if this is strictly and ADHD thing, or a me thing.\n\nDeadline adrenaline is roughly leaving something so late to the last minute that I'm basically fucked if I don't finish it in X hours. School papers, project deadlines, even packing a house or submitting some documents, many of these things in my life get done this way.\n\nOften tasks that seem impossible I'm able to pull off with ease leaning on this, but it means it can be difficult to worth with others effectively. My managers are always terrified and then shocked when in a day I turn around an entire project, or complete what seems like an impossible amount of work in a short time.\n\nThis process I go through is part of the ADHD cycles I experience, which I'd love to write about more later.\n\nThe super TL;DR is when not on medication I experience pretty severe cycles on both roughly a daily and monthly basis. These cover energy, creative output, focus and more.\n\nIt makes it extremely difficult to work with others if a creative or energy high doesn't align with where others are at the time, but also when my cycle highs align with a project or collaboration people are often amazed at both the volume and quality of my output (and then probably confused why a week later I can't seem to create two screens.)\n\nErr, we went on a bit of a tangent here though, so lets get to point 3!\n\nBeing socially inappropriate\n\nThis one is pretty straight forward for me. Let me say this first, I recognize I'm VERY, SUPER privileged to be able to work this way.\n\nI don't work with people, companies, etc that require me to do anything in a certain way. Need to dress a certain way? That is a nope. Talk or write formally? That is a nope. Maybe seems messed up, but it's how my brain works Â¯\\(ãƒ„)/Â¯\n\nI am fortunate that I've been able to find a career path that I've been able to design a way to create that works for me, and brings people value, but I think many ADHD people's potential is never even given a chance to shine because they can't engage with the world the way the world wants them to.\n\nI was blessed with some incredible teachers and mentors that saw the value in me despite my \"weirdness\" that I was never able to define until recently.\n\nI think we leave a lot of great people behind because they can't or don't work the way the world wants them to. I'd be still in my parents basement if my only options were suit & tie or on my feet at 8am in retail. (Y'all are the unsung heroes, doing some of the hardest work with completely unjust levels of compensation. Thank you, and I hope we can improve the way you all have to work in my lifetime.)\n\nTo wrap up this section: I've always done the worst when I tried to fit myself into the mould of the \"Normal.\" I end up coming off just as a slightly ok-ish designer. I've found resounding success in the past few years when I've leaned into the me unapologetically, even though I recognize it can be hard to work with and around.\n\nI have the utmost respect for managers and leaders that can utilize the odd-shaped puzzle pieces like myself and figure out where they fit.\n\nFeeling Misunderstood\n\nMoving on to the biggest one â€“ Feeling misunderstood. This is the root of almost all social issues that ADHD brings for me personally.\n\nFeel like someone didn't understand what you said â€“ here comes 10 minutes of exposition to try to explain that one statement I said, meanwhile the whole group is slowly edging away to get away from this odd guy.\n\nPost a piece of writing online? \"People will pick apart every statement.\", \"Don't post that, people won't understand what you mean.\" The amount of self-censorship you do from fear of being misunderstood is both socially crippling, and highly career negative.\n\nWhen I worked at Facebook, one thing I always struggled with is there is this idea of as you become a more senior designer you build more of a public following, and begin to have an impact on our industry. This was always crippling for me to even think about, because of the fear of doing or saying something wrong and then being outcast.\n\nThe feeling of being misunderstood to and ADHD person is TERRIFYING. I still have a thousand minor slights or social awkwardness I've committed that I think about weekly, and am just begging in my head to be able to go back and explain or correct.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nEven as I start this wrap up, I basically feel like I just wrote a bunch of stuff that people won't really get anything out of because of it being highly disjointed.\n\nBut I'll throw it out there since I'm trying to get better at challenging my assumptions and learning more about myself and my ADHD through sharing with others and getting feedback.\n\nThis meandered a bit from just focusing on writing, but writing is HARD for ADHD people. I'm trying to do it more to get better, and identify how the above things affect me and my writing and how I can improve it.\n\nI one-shot this writing, so apologies for any issues, spelling, flow or otherwise. I'm always open to talk about design, ADHD and more. You can reach me at iamnbutler@gmail.com.\n\nHope this is interesting or useful to someone!\n\nNate ðŸŒ±"

I thought a minimal generative series using pixels and mapping equations would be a fun way to try it out.\n\nProcess\n\nI started by pushing on nesting shapes â€“ How does it look when you nest and rotate shapes continuously? I got some cool outcomes like below, but I realized that most of the gens would end up looking pretty similar, relying so heavily on rotation.\n\nExploring a different direction, I remembered playing with graphing calculators back in high school â€“ Using trig functions like sin, cos, and tan, I got some exciting results right off the bat.\n\nOnce I found a few directions I liked, I realized that these gens would probably show best in some sort of frame, especially if I wanted to show a few together. I went with the simplest outline possible to keep everything monochrome and on theme.\n\nIn the end, I didn't use any nesting to create each gen. Frames 1px tall and 1~6px wide (randomized) are charted in 2D along the x-axis using the repeat's {{index}}.\n\nThe generative functions are mostly created using sin, cos, tan, a randomizer variable, and {{index}} combined in different ways.\n\nMy favorite thing so far about Automator is how quickly I was able to explore a ton of variations. I was able to create over 60 gens with some really wide variation in under 2 hours.\n\nHere are some of my favorite gens:\n\nI'm looking forward to exploring another generative series soon, following everything I learned with this one!\n\nYou can find some of the JSON import files I saved as I was exploring in the fig-gen repo.\n\n---\n\nJordan Singer's Automator plugin is currently in closed beta.
